      "Colloidal quantum dots (QDs) are promising candidate materials for photovoltaics (PV) owing to the tunable bandgap and low-cost solution processability. Lead selenide (PbSe) QDs are particularly attractive to PV applications due to the efficient multiple-exciton generation and carrier transportation. However, surface defects arising from the oxidation of the PbSe QDs have been the major limitation for their development in PV. Here, a new passivation method for chlorinated PbSe QDs via ion exchange with cesium lead halide (Br, I) perovskite nanocrystals is reported. The surface chloride ions on the as-synthesized QDs can be partially exchanged with bromide or iodide ions from the perovskite nanocrystals, hence forming a hybrid halide passivation. Consistent with the improved photoluminescence quantum yield, the champion PV device fabricated with these PbSe QDs achieves a PCE of 8.2%, compared to 7.3% of that fabricated with the untreated QDs. This new method also leads to devices with excellent air-stability, retaining at least 93% of their initial PCEs after being stored in ambient conditions for 57 d. This is considered as the first reported PbSe QD solar cell with a PCE of over 8% to date.\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated a new passivation method for PbSe QDs using Cs-based perovskite NCs as the halide source. By direct halide ion exchange, this method can provide robust hybrid Cl/Br or Cl/I passivation to PbSe QDs, resulting a significant improvement in the PLQY. We fabricated solar cells with these well-passivated QDs and achieved a champion device with a PCE of 8.2%, which is the most efficient PbSe QDSC reported to date. The significant improvement in PCE was contributed by the increases in both VOC and FF, in agreement with our results in PLQY and TA measurements. The devices fabricated by perovskite-treated PbSe QDs also demonstrated excellent air-stability, retaining >93% of their initial PCEs over 57 d. We conclude that this new passivation method is an effective way of producing high-quality PbSe QDs and PV devices. It should provide a useful platform for the research in lead chalcogenide QD-based optoelectronic devices.\n",
      "         Synthesis of PbSe QDs: PbSe QDs with a first exciton peak at 860 nm (1.4 eV) were synthesized using the cation exchange method according to Zhang et al. and a previous report with some modifications. [         \n",

      "         Notably the best performing device comprising GO-Li layer showed a remarkable improvement in PCE (+12%) in comparison with the performance of the reference sample. In particular the PCE improvement can be related to an increase of JSC (+10.5%) and the FF (+7.5%) while the VOC undergoes a slight decrease (6%). The small VOC change is consistent with the fact that the main role of the ultrathin GO-Li layer is to facilitate the electron injection into the TiO2 layer.[         \n",

Polyvinylidene difluoride (PVDF) transfer membrane (0.45 m) was used to filter and collect the solid, which was then dissolved in water (20 mL). The process of dissolution and filtration was repeated two times. The prepared GO-Li was dissolved in water:ethanol (1:3).[         \n",
      "         Perovskite Solar Cells Realization: Solar cells with an active area of 0.1 cm2 were prepared on fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) conductive glass (Pilkington, 8  1, 25 mm  25 mm) patterned through raster scanning laser ( = 1064 nm, Nd:YVO4 pulsed at 30 kHz, average output power P = 10 W). The patterned substrates were cleaned in an ultrasonic bath, using detergent with deionized water, acetone, and 2-propanol (10 min for each step). A patterned compact TiO2 (c-TiO2) layer was deposited onto the patterned FTO by spray pyrolysis deposition. To measure the final thickness of the c-TiO2 a Dektak Veeco 150 profilometer was used; the thickness of this layer was measured about 70 nm and verified by SEM image reported in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). Patterning of the c-TiO2 was achieved using a screen printed metal mask which was removed after the c-TiO2 deposition using an HCl-based acidic solution and deionized water. A 350 nm nanocrystalline mesoporous m-TiO2 layer (18NR-T paste, Dyesol, diluted with terpineol and ethyl cellulose) was screen-printed onto the c-TiO2 surface and successively sintered at 500 C for 30 min. The perovskite active layer deposition was conducted by double step method; a lead iodide solution (PbI2 in N,N-dimethylformamide, 460 mg mL1 heated at 70 C) was spincoated at 6000 rpm for 10 s and then heated at 80 C for 1 h in glove-box environment. CH3NH3PbI3 crystallization was achieved by employing the vapor assisted deposition technique proposed by Chen et al.[         \n",

A thickness of about 140 nm for the Spiro-MeOTAD layer was extracted by crosssection SEM image reported in Figure S5 (Supporting Information). The final devices were left in air overnight in a closed box containing silica desiccant prior to realizing the gold contacts (100 nm) by means of high vacuum thermal evaporation.\n",
      "Raman spectra were acquired by using a JobinYvonHoriba microRaman system (LabRAM ARAMIS) equipped with Ar+ ion laser (514 nm) as the excitation source. The cut-off from the notch filters in the spectrometer is less than 100 cm1. The laser light reached the sample surface at normal incidence by means of ultralong working distance (50) objective with 10.5 mm focal distance. The scattered radiation was collected in a backscattering geometry by a spectrometer equipped with a diffraction grating of 1800 lines per mm coupled to a chargecoupled device (CCD) camera. Spectral deconvolution was carried out by nonlinear least-squares fitting of the Raman peaks to a mixture of Lorentzian and Gaussian line shapes, providing the peak position, width, height, and integrated intensity of each Raman band.\n",
      "M CH3NH3PbI3 and mixed halide variants, have etal halide perovskite semiconductors, such as recently become a commercially relevant material for photovoltaic (PV) and light emission applications14. With photovoltaic solar to electrical power conversion efficiencies (PCE) surpassing 20% on laboratory-type cells5, they are already promising to emerge as a close competitor to crystalline silicon solar cells. Easy fabrication of polycrystalline perovskite thin films with high crystallinity has been central to the rapid advancement of the solar cell performance. However, there still remains much scope for further improvement since there exists significant heterogeneity in the polycrystalline films6, and little is known about the defect chemistry710. Impurities and defects introduced during the fabrication process could potentially act as non-radiative recombination centres and subsequently harm the photophysical properties of the perovskite films. High-performance semiconductor devices generally require high purity and low-defect materials to deliver the best performance11. Passivation of electronic defects at grain boundaries has been central to the advancement of thin-film solar technologies based on copper indium gallium selenide (CIGS)12 and CdTe13, in addition to polycrystalline silicon14. The energetic potential barrier at perovskite grains has been shown to be low, in the region of thermal energy15. However, recent reports of large crystalline domains delivering enhanced charge-carrier lifetimes point towards the detriment of grain boundaries and grain surfaces are additionally likely to be the source of mobile ionic species responsible for hysteresis in the solar cells current-voltage curves1618. More recently still, deQuilettes et al. have examined polycrystalline perovskite thin films and observed fast photoluminescence (PL) quenching at grain boundaries, which is attributed to a large densities of non-radiative centres in these regions6. If we compare polycrystalline thin films to single crystals of MAPbI3 (ref. 18), then single crystals grown very slowly from solution have been shown to have defect densities of as low as 109 to 1010 cm 3. In comparison, polycrystalline thin films general have defect densities in the order of 1016 cm 3 indicating much room for improvement19. We do note that provided the defect density is lower than the density of free carriers generated under photovoltaic operation under sunlight, their impact on the electronic operation will be minimal. However, this is likely to require reducing the density to the order of 1014 or lower in the polycrystalline thin films. Hence understanding what parameters in the film preparation influence defect generation, and what means can be devised to reduce defect density will be central to advancing the performance and large-area reproducibility of perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "SPO (%) Photovoltaic performance and characterization. Finally, we fabricated planar heterojunction perovskite solar cells composed of FTO glass/c-TiO2/perovskite thin film/spiro-OMeTAD/Ag. In Supplementary Fig. 5 we show the dependence of the device performance with varying precursor concentration. We found that a 30 wt% precursor solution gives the best PCE, after which the device performance drops sharply with increasing concentration. We therefore fixed the precursor concentration at 30 wt%, and added HPA over a range of molar ratios of HPA to PbAc2 3H2O (Supplementary Table 1). We summarize the solar cell performance results, at optimized HPA concentration (molar ratio of 7.5% for HPA/PbAc2 3H2O), with s.d. in Table 1. We extracted the efficiencies quoted from measuring the currentvoltage curve under simulated AM 1.5 sunlight at 100 mW cm 2 irradiance scanned from forward bias to short-circuit conditions.\n",
      "Interestingly, we observed that the photocurrent is greatly enhanced by adding HPA into the precursor solution, which is consistent with the reduction of defect sites that could partake in trap-assisted recombination. At the optimal molar ratio of HPA/ PbAc2 3H2O, the average short-circuit current density (Jsc) reaches a value of 20.1 mA cm 2. This increase is impressive considering the film thickness is only 200 nm, which is much thinner than what is used in most of the highly efficient planar heterojuction devices, which show an optimum film thickness around 350500 nm. The enhancement in Jsc is what leads to the improvement in the PCE, since the open-circuit voltage (Voc) and fill factor (FF) are only marginally improved. We obtain an average PCE of 15.6% at the optimized HPA concentration, which corresponds to an increase of B54% as compared with the control devices, which were fabricated without the addition of HPA. These devices have an average PCE of 10.1%. The champion cell shows excellent performance with a Jsc of 20.4 mA cm 2, a Voc of 1.07 V and a FF of 0.74, leading to a PCE of 16.2%, greatly outperforming the champion control cell which has a Jsc of 17.2 mA cm 2, a Voc of 1.07 V and a FF of 0.72, leading to a PCE of 13.2%. Also, the much narrower s.d., which we observe in the group with HPA suggests that the device performance is more reproducible as compared with the control devices without HPA. We note that in our previous work where we employed PbAc2 3H2O with lab-made MAI, we showed an average PCE of 14.0% with a champion cell PCE of 15.2% (ref. 27). However, as we explained near the start of the results section, for our previous work we employed MAI, which had not been purified via recrystallization. We expect that HPA, present as an impurity (residual from the HI solution), was responsible for enhancing the previously reported solar cells and they can therefore not be viewed as HPA-free device and compared directly with the control device, which we show in the present work. For the same reason, we emphasize again that the highefficiency devices that we have previously reported fabricated employing the mixed halide lead precursor route (PbCl2  3 MAI) could have also been partially enhanced due to the contribution of HPA in the lab-made non-recrystallized MAI power which we have employed throughout all our previous work9,10,45, although neither at an optimal concentration nor a controlled level. This is supported by the results which we show below and in Supplementary Table 2.\n",
      "Perovskite solution preparation. Methylamine iodide (MAI) was purchased from Dyesol and used as received. Lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc2 3H2O) (99.999% trace metals basis, CAS No. 6080-56-4) and hypophosphorous acid (HPA) solution (50 wt% in water, CAS No. 6303-21-5) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. To create the perovskite precursor solution, MAI and PbAc2 3H2O were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-Dimethylformamide at a 3:1 molar ratio with final concentrations of 2840 wt%. Then HPA solution was added in the precursor solution with a molar ratio of HPA/PbAc2 3H2O in the range of 5.010.0%.\n",
      "Substrate preparation. Devices were fabricated on FTO-coated glass (Pilkington, 7O/square). Initially, FTO was removed from regions under the anode contact by etching the FTO with 2 M HCl and zinc powder. Substrates were then cleaned sequentially in 2% Hellmanex detergent, acetone, propan-2-ol and oxygen plasma. A hole-blocking layer of compact TiO2 was deposited by spin-coating a mildly acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in ethanol, and annealed at 500 C for 30 min. Spin-coating was carried out at 2,000 r.p.m for 45 s.\n",
      "Perovskite deposition. For devices, the perovskites were prepared by spin coating a perovskite solution at 2,000 r.p.m for 45 s in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. After spin-coating, the films were left on the bench drying for 1015 min then annealed at 100 C for 5 min. 7 wt% spiro-OMeTAD hole-transporting layer was then deposited from a chlorobenzene solution containing additives of lithium bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide and 4-tert-butylpyridine at 2,000 r.p.m for 45 s. Finally, 120-nm silver electrodes were thermally evaporated under vacuum of B10 6 torr, at a rate of B0.1 nm s 1, to complete the devices.\n",
      "To assess the impact of structural and optoelectronic characteristics of PEA-incorporated large Eg perovskites on performance, we fabricate PV devices using a pin device configuration (preferred for PVKPVK tandems) with NiOx hole-transport layer (HTL) and fullerene electron-transport layer (ETL) (Figure S7a). Device fabrication details are provided in Experimental Section. Initially, based on our previous work, we use C60 for ETL.13 The corresponding currentvoltage (JV) characteristics and PV performance metrics for PEA0-PEA20 devices are shown in Figure S7b,c. The increase in Voc from 1.17 V (PEA0) to 1.26 V (PEA20) shows the positive effect of improvement in material quality. Even though the increasing trend in Voc follows QFLS results, Voc values are considerably lower than their corresponding QFLS values (Figure 4a). The added Voc,loss in devices indicate that with improvement in absorber optoelectronic quality, additional limitations on Voc imposed by the nonoptimized interfacial contacts are apparent.\n",
      "We subsequently fabricate another series of devices with an alternate fullerene variant doped-Indene-C60 bis-adduct (IC60BA) as ETL, which has been found beneficial for improving the quality of perovskite/ETL interface.13,26,35,54 The JV characteristics and associated PV performance metrics for PEA0-PEA20 devices with IC60BA ETL are shown in Figures 6a and S8a-b, respectively. Strikingly, Voc values are significantly improved compared to their C60 ETL counterparts. The highest Voc (1.231.35 V) for each of the composition (PEA0-PEA20) precisely agree with the corresponding QFLS values (Figure 6b) and distinctly overcome the photovoltage plateau in large Eg perovskites (Figure 1). This shows the importance of synergetic development of perovskite absorber and coupled interfaces to mitigate Voc deficit and will become more crucial as absorber optoelectronic quality is further improved.\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated the structural and optoelectronic merits of PEA incorporation in mixed-halide perovskites to solve the inherent material-level and device-level issues in 1.8 eV Eg PVKSCs. Material insights obtained from detailed investigation regarding the influence of PEA on crystallite size, orientation, optoelectronic quality, and carrier recombination dynamics are valuable beyond the scope of this work. Incorporation of PEA considerably improved the QFLS and slowed down the rate of phase segregation in 1.8 eV Eg perovskites. With judiciously chosen PEA fractions and interfaces, the improved material characteristics were effectively translated to devices. In perspective to literature, Voc values of 1.301.35 V achieved in this work overcome the photovoltage plateau in 1.801.85 eV Eg range and represent the highest Voc achieved thus far for mixed-halide hybrid PVKSCs (Figure 1a). The corresponding Voc/Voc,SQ values of 0.850.87 are comparable to the best value of 0.86 realized in the more pervasively explored 1.651.75 eV Eg range (Figure 1b). This minimizes the disparity in Voc/Voc,SQ values when compared to the lower Eg variants and is a significant step forward for 1.80 1.85 Eg PVKSCs. Results in this work clearly establish that synergetic development of perovskite absorber with improved optoelectronic quality and coupled interfaces are pivotal for mitigating Voc,loss in large Eg PVKSCs. Future research efforts to explore defect passivation approaches and alternate device architectures will further unleash the potential of large Eg PVKSC platform developed here for next generation perovskite tandems.\n",
      "In summary, we employed the DMF-treated PEDOT:PSS and PMMA-modified PCBM as the HSC and ESC, respectively, to establish charge-carrier balance in the inverted PHJ PSCs. The DMF treatment helps to enhance the conductivity of PEDOT:PSS film and reduce its surface roughness, which facilitates the interfacial contact between the perovskite layer and HSC. We also improved the PCBM film morphology by the introduction of PMMA. The interface engineering of HSC and ESC resulted in accelerated and balanced charge-carrier transport in the device, leading to the suppressed charge-carrier wileyonlinelibrary.com accumulation and recombination. This strategy enables us to achieve a high PCE of 18.72% with a stabilized output efficiency of 17.70% at the maximum power point. This study provides a simple and effective protocol to improve the performance of PSCs based on the interface charge-carrier-transport modulation.\n",

The mixture solutions were spun onto PEDOT:PSS at a rate of 4000 rounds per minute for 30 seconds. The perovskite lms were annealed at 100 C for 1560 minutes.

      "         The fabrication of perovskites via solution-processing methods leads to their fast crystallization, leading to perovskite films with unintended defects such as structural disorders (dislocations, grain boundaries, pinholes, and cracks). These defects influence the optoelectronic properties and stability of MHPs and devices. The defects create trap states within the bandgap of the MHPs, which lead to nonradiative recombination and interrupt the charge transport. Moreover, the defects in MHPs can be affected by extrinsic factors such as moisture, heat, and light,[         \n",
      "The fabricated TiO2 metasurfaces are integrated with polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microfluidic chips for the realization of reconfigurable colors (see Figure 2a and Supporting Information). Figure 4a shows the image of the microfluidic chip, where the solvents are mechanically injected and ejected through the pipes, and the metasurface is embedded in the fluidic channel. Taking a TiO2 metasurface with p = 350 nm and g = 60 nm as an example, its optical properties within different injected solvents have been studied and plotted in Figure 4b. Due to the hydrophilic surfaces of TiO2 nanoblocks, the injected solution can fully cover the metasurfaces (see Supporting Information).57 Thus, the refractive index of surrounding media (nsur) increases from 1.00 to 1.333, 1.4795, and 1.6276 with the injection of water, DMSO, and CS2. Correspondingly, the reflection peak at 530 nm shifts to 550, 570, and 590 nm, whereas the peak at 550 nm moves to 570, 590, and 610 nm, respectively. Both transitions are consistent with the numerical results in Figure 1. Meanwhile, we find that the maximal reflectance values are well preserved in all of the reflection spectra, and thus, we can expect the transitions in their corresponding structural colors.\n",
      "As mentioned above, the proximity resonance can significantly increase the scattering cross section.52 As a result, brightfield colors can be generated with a relatively small period number.41 Our numerical calculations show that 8  8 and 6  6 TiO2 nanoblock arrays are good enough to generate distinct colors (see Supporting Information). In this sense, the microfluidic reconfigurable TiO2 metasurfaces have the ability to produce high-resolution tunable color images. One example is shown in Figure 4e. It is a 500 m  500 m color image of the logo of our university (Harbin Institute of Technology). The corresponding high-resolution and low-resolution SEM images are shown in the Supporting Information. Each pixel of the image is an 8  8 TiO2 metasurface with p = 350 nm and g = 60 nm, following the structures in Figure 4b. When the sample is illuminated with white light, a bright green university logo can be seen. With the injection of water, DMSO, and CS2 into the microfluidic channel, yellow, dark yellow, and golden color images have been obtained accordingly, demonstrating their potential in reconfigurable color images. The color images in Figure 4e do not show any distortion and can be used in animations.\n",
      "Numerical Simulation. In this work, all the numerical analysis was performed using commercially available finite element method based software, known as COMSOL Multiphysics. The simulation was performed on one unit cell with periodic boundary conditions.

      "         Herein, we report an effective additive technique developed to control the perovskite morphology on eflxible substrates for F-PSCs. In particular, when dimethyl suldfie (DS) additive was used, quality of the perovskite lfim was found signicfiantly improved on eflxible substrates. Specicfially, both the grain size and crystallinity were signicfiantly enhanced. We speculate that the DS molecule chelates with Pb2+ to form an intermediate complex when the DS was introduced into the perovskite precursor solution, resulting in smaller Gibbs free energy and slower growth rate for perovskite crystallization. Furthermore, the chelation interaction efcfiiently retards transformation kinetics during the thin lfim crystallization process, leading to reduced trap density in the perovskite lfim. [         \n",
      "         The perovskite precursor solution with concentration of 1.2 mol L1 for PbI2 and CH3NH3I (MAI) was prepared under stirring at 60 C for 2 h. Then, different volume ratios of DS were added into the filtered perovskite solution, and the mixed solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The MAPI3DS perovskite films were fabricated by spin-coating and obtained after heating at 100 C for 10 min. More details can be seen in the Experimental Section. Figure 1a,b shows the top-view scanning electron microscope (SEM) images of CH3NH3PbI3 (MAPbI3) films prepared without and with the DS additive (MAPbI3DS). The perovskite grain size obviously increases when the DS additive was used. Figure 1c shows grain size distribution for these two samples. It is clear that the average grain size of the MAPbI3 film made without additive is only 151 nm, it is increased to as large as 409 nm when it is prepared using the DS additive, as labeled MAPbI3DS. Figure S1 (Supporting Information) shows the atomic force microscopy (AFM) height images of MAPbI3 and MAPbI3DS samples. The root-mean-square (RMS) roughness of the MAPbI3 DS is increased to 11.1 from 7.76 nm for the MAPbI3. The slightly bigger RMS is reported to help light trapping, which is beneficial to enhanced J sc.[         \n",
      "         Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR) is performed to understand the function of DS additive in the perovskite thin film deposition process. Figure S2 (Supporting Information) shows the molecular structures of the -butyrolactone (GBL) solvent and the DS additive. Figure S3 (Supporting Information) displays the FTIR spectra of GBL, DS, GBL+PbI2, and GBL+PbI2+DS samples, with their signature peak attribution 1801418 (2 of 9) summarized in Table S1 (Supporting Information). It is clear that the GBL peaks show no significant change when PbI 2 was dissolved, indicating that there is no reaction between GBL and PbI2. In comparison, for the DS sample, its characteristic peak ascribed to CS stretching vibration appears at 973 cm1,[         \n",
      "         The F-PSCs based on MAPbI3 and MAPbI3DS were fabricated to analyze the effect of the DS additive. Figure 2a illustrates the F-PSC structure, wherein a 60 nm thick Nb2O5 layer was used as the ESL as deposited according to our previous report,[         \n",
      "         The hysteresis of the flexible devices was also investigated, as seen in Figure 2c and Table 1. It is apparent that the F-PSC without DS additive shows more severe hysteresis with the PCE of only 11.30% under forward scan condition, degraded by 34% compared with reverse scan directions. The F-PSC with the DS additive exhibits significantly reduced hysteresis, and the PCE is as high as 17.02% under forward scan condition, decreased by 7% in contrast to reverse scan directions. As, it is known that the hysteresis may be caused by ion migration, trap states, and ferroelectric effect within the perovskite absorber.[         \n",
      "In conclusion, the effective DS additive has been successfully developed to improve the PCE of F-PSCs. The efficiency of the MAPbI3 flexible device with small area is enhanced to as high as 18.40%, and the large area F-PSC achieves to 13.35%, both efficiencies are the highest reported to date for F-PSCs. Careful JV analysis shows that the large area cell gives identical Voc as the small area cells, with proper design of large area device to ensure controlled Rs, it is expected that the PCE of large area cell may be significantly increased. In addition, the environmental stability of the F-PSCs is significantly improved when the DS additive is used. The excellent performance of the MAPbI3DS flexible devices is attributed to large grain size and good crystallinity of the resultant perovskite absorber layer, thanks to the decreased Gibbs free energy and slowed down growth rate for perovskite crystallization process when Pb2+ forms chelated intermediate with DS. It is expected that the present strategy will help guide development of large-scale F-PSCs for practical applications.\n",

      "In summary, we performed alcohol vapors annealing treatment on the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films, aiming to improve the crystal growth and increase the grain size of the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal, thus boosting the device performance of perovskite hybrid PVs. By selectively controlling the CH3NH3I precursor, fine-tuning the CH3NH3PbI3 crystal growth can be realized, which generates large-grain size, higher crystallinity, and pinhole-free CH3NH3PbI3 thin films. As a result, high performance perovskite hybrid PVs including pero-HSCs and photodetectors are observed. It is also found that the CH3NH3PbI3 thin films possess more highly ordered crystal formation upon treated by alcohol solvents with higher polarity (methanol and ethanol) than their lower polarity analog (2-propanol). The highly ordered CH3NH3PbI3 crystals would be favorable for the charge transfer process in the perovskite PVs. As a result, greatly increased efficiencies with excellent reproducibility and eliminated hysteresis behavior are observed from pero-HSCs, and significantly improved detectivities are realized in pero-HPDs. Thus, our method provides a facile way to boost the device performance of perovskite PVs.\n",

      "Here, we investigate how the perovskite film microstructure, such as grain boundaries and grain size, affects the light soaking phenomenon in mixed-halide perovskite solar cells. To the best of our knowledge, it has not yet been explored how the perovskite film microstructure affects the light soaking phenomenon in planar perovskite solar cells. We demonstrate that devices using noncompact perovskite films (open grain boundaries) show severe light soaking effect, with the open circuit voltage (VOC) improving from 0.42 to 0.87 V, fill factor (FF) improving from 0.46 to 0.7, and PCE improving from 3.7% to 11.6% after light soaking (illumination for more than 1 h). Instead, devices with compact (fused grain boundaries) perovskite film morphology show a very weak light soaking effect with the VOC improved from 0.86 to 0.88 V, FF improved 0.72 to 0.74, and PCE improved from 11.4% to 11.9%. Light intensity-dependent VOC and photoluminescence (PL) combined with impedance spectroscopy (IS) measurements indicate that severe trap-assisted recombination of the charge carriers takes place in devices using noncompact perovskite films, and it is effectively suppressed in devices using compact films. The fact that the devices using compact films with smaller grain sizes show a negligible light soaking effect indicates that the trap density is reduced when grain boundaries are fused. Our experimental results demonstrate that interface electron traps are the source for the light soaking effect in HPSCs.\n",
      "Devices fabricated with compact perovskite films show negligible change in light soaking with temperature, which is in agreement with the fact that the compact packing of perovskite crystallites can effectively reduce iodine vacancies due to the fused grain boundaries (see Figure 8b,d).\n",
      "In conclusion, we have investigated how the grain boundaries and grain size in perovskite films affect the charge recombination and light soaking effect in HPSCs. We find that interface trap-assisted recombination dominates the light soaking effect. The devices made with a compact perovskite film show very weak light soaking effect due to lower trap-assisted recombination, while those with a noncompact perovskite film show a strong light soaking effect due to significant trap-assisted recombination. Our results demonstrate that improving the morphology of the perovskite film to eliminate the grain boundaries is an effective way to eliminate the light soaking effect. wileyonlinelibrary.com flu pear\n",

A surface-reaction-limited pulsed chemical vapor deposition (SPCVD) technique was employed to fabricate the 3D TiO2 architecture,45 where the CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite was deposited using the sequential deposition method.30 The highest PCE yielded by the 3D TiO2 structure was found to be 9.0%, which was substantially higher than perovskite SCs made from ZnO NWs, TiO2-coated ZnO NWs, and TiO2 nanotubes (NT). Over 8% of PCEs have been achieved on the basis of 3D TiO2 with length variations ranging from 600 nm to 1.4 m. Furthermore, enhanced light absorption at the visible light region, increased electron mobility, and low hysteresis effects were observed from the 3D TiO2-based perovskite SCs.\n",
      "3D TiO2 NW architecture was synthesized inside a homemade atomic layer deposition (ALD) system using ZnO NW arrays as the template and TiCl4 and H2O as the precursors. TiO2 NT was formed after 10 cycles of deposition through the cation-exchange reaction governed by the Kirkendall effect.45 Subsequently, the SPCVD process dominated the growth, forming high-density single crystalline TiO2 nanorods (NRs) on the entire TiO2 NT stem (see the Methods section for details). Figure 1a shows scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images of as-received treelike 3D TiO2 NW structures (inset of Figure 1a). The interspace between individual TiO2 nanostructures was from 160 to 430 nm, which was within the range of the grain size distribution of perovskite acquired from the sequential deposition approach, implying possible full CH3NH3PbI3 coverage of the open space. TEM characterizations on a branched NW demonstrate the dense and uniform TiO2 NR distribution along the entire trunk with a density of 70 NRs per m (Figure 1b). The trunk is polycrystalline with a hollow center (Figure 1c), which manifests the Kirkendall effect induced by different ionic diffusion rates of the ZnO core and TiO2 shell during the vapor-phase deposition.45 The shell thickness of the TiO2 NT core was found to be 12 nm. A high-resolution TEM (HRTEM) image reveals the high-quality lattice of single crystalline TiO2 NRs which do not show any line or planar defects. Lattice spacing measured from the HRTEM image was 0.48 and 0.35 nm, perfectly matching the (002) and (011) planes of anatase TiO2, respectively.46,47 Besides the dominated anatase phase, rutile TiO2 was also observed from the X-ray diffraction (XRD) pattern (Figure 1d), which was likely formed in the stem portion where foreign elements, such as Zn, were involved.45\n",

In general, by increasing the length of the 3D TiO2 scaffolds, Jsc was increased accordingly, while Voc and FF of cells were decreased.

The substrate with seeds was immersed in the nutrient solution with the seeded surface facing downward. The nutrient solution comprised 25 mM zinc nitrate and 25 mM hexamethylenetetramine (HMT). ZnO NW length was controlled by the growing time, where 1 h and 10 min yielded 600 nm NWs, 2 h for 1.0 m, 3 h and 20 min for  1.4 m, and 4 h for 1.7 m.\n",
      "Synthesis of 3D TiO2 NW Architecture. 3D TiO2 NW architecture was synthesized in a homemade ALD system following the procedures described in our previous publication.45 Assynthesized ZnO NW arrays were placed at the center of the ALD chamber. N2 gas with a flow rate of 40 sccm was used to carry precursors into the chamber, generating a base pressure of 4.1 Torr. TiCl4 and H2O vapors were used as the precursors and pulsed into the furnace separately with a pulsing time of 500 ms and separated by 60 s N2 purging. Therefore, one deposition cycle involves 500 ms of H2O pulse 60 s of N2 purging 500 ms of TiCl4 pulse 60 s of N2 purging. The pressure change of TiCl4 pulses was 110 mTorr. The chamber temperature was believed to be a result of decreased charge-generation efficiency, increased charge recombination, and higher electron-transport resistance. The best PCE was offered by the 600 nm 3D TiO2 scaffold with a value of 9.0%. Compared to 1D TiO2 nanostructures made through the same process, the PCE of 3D TiO2 was 1.5 times higher. It was even 2.3 and 2.8 times higher than that of TiO2-coated ZnO NWs and ZnO NW-based perovskite SCs, respectively. The high-density 3D TiO2 architecture allowed higher perovskite loading and enhanced light harvesting compared with simple 1D nanostructure arrays. C-AFM also revealed a substantially improved conductivity compared to regular TiO2 nanostructures, which promoted the charge-transport properties. In addition, PV cells comprising 3D TiO2 are found to be favorable in suppressing the hysteresis effect that is often observed from planar perovskite SCs. Compared to the best performed CH3NH3PbI3 perovskite solar devices, the efficiency of the 3D TiO2 based one is still a little lower. One possible reason is the competitive light absorption induced by the doped essence of 3D TiO2, which could negatively affect the light harvesting by perovskite and subsequently hamper Jsc of the device. Nevertheless, the 3D hierarchical NWs morphology has convincingly shown advantages in terms of photoactive materials loading, electron delivering, and light scattering. It offers a promising candidate for understanding the property performance relationship in perovskite solar cells and developing high-performance solar energy harvesting devices. remained at 600 C during the entire growth process. Subsequently, the furnace was cooled down naturally under N2 flow. The hollow TiO2 NT was created after 10 cycles of deposition. 400 cycles of deposition yielded the 3D TiO2 NW architecture. TiO2-coated ZnO NWs were fabricated in the same ALD system by 400 cycles of TiO2 deposition at 300 C, yielding 29 nm thick polycrystalline TiO2 film on ZnO NW surface.\n",
      "Perovskite Solar Cell Fabrication. Sequential deposition approach was used to load perovskite onto 3D TiO2.30 Methylammonium iodide (CH3NH3I) was first synthesized following the literature.53 Specifically, methylamine (24 mL, 33 wt % in ethanol, Aldrich) reacted with hydroiodic acid (10 mL, 27 wt % in water) in ethanol (100 mL) under nitrogen atmosphere at room temperature for 2 h. Then, the solution was evaporated at 80 C until white colored powder of CH3NH3I crystal was precipitated. PbI2 (99%, Aldrich) was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide under stirring at 70 C to yield a concentration of 460 mg/mL. The PbI2 solution was infiltrated into the 3D TiO2, TiO2 NT, ZnO NW, TiO2-coated ZnO NW, and mesoporous TiO2 scaffolds by spin coating at 3000 rpm for 30 s and dried at 70 C for 30 min. After being cooled to room temperature, the PbI2coated samples were first prewetted in 2-propanol solution for 2 s and then immersed into solution of CH3NH3I in 2-propanol (10 mg/mL) for 70 s, followed by 2-propanol solution rinsing again. After drying in the air for several minutes, the films were heated at 70 C for 30 min. HTM was then coated by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 45 s. HTM solution was prepared by dissolving 75 mg of (2,20,7,70-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9spirobifluorene)(spiro-MeOTAD), 28 L of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17 L of solution that contains 520 mg/mL of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulfony)imide in acetonitrile into 1 mL of chlorobenzene. Finally, 100 nm of silver was deposited by thermal evaporation on the top of the device.\n",
      "A planar cell in Figure S5 (Supporting Information) was fabricated according to ref 33. Briefly, 0.2 g of CH3NH3I and 0.578 g of PbI2 was mixed in 1 mL of anhydrous N,N-dimethylformamide by shaking at room temperature for 15 min, and a clear CH3NH3PbI3 solution was obtained with a concentration of 45%. Sequentially, 100 L of CH3NH3PbI3 solution was dropped onto TiO2-coated FTO substrate and spun at 5000 rpm. After spinning at 5000 rpm for 5 s, 100 L anhydrous chlorobenzene was quickly dropped onto the center of the substrate and then the color of substrate was changed to light brown. Total spin time was 30 s.\n",
      "The mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20 nm-sized particles was deposited by spin coating at 2000 rpm for 60 s using a commercial TiO2 paste (Dyesol 18NRT, Dyesol) diluted in terpineol (1:3, weight ratio). After drying at 150 C for 15 min, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 C and baked at this temperature for 30 min.\n",
      "Device Characterization. J V curves were measured with a solar simulator equipped with 150 W xenon lamp (6255, Newport) and Keithley 2636 source-meter. The light intensity was adjusted to 1 sun (100 mW/cm2), and the active area was confined to 0.785 mm2. The IPCE was measured with a quartz tungsten halogen lamp modulated by a chopper wheel and a monochromator. The signal was recorded using a Stanford Research Systems lock-in amplifier at zero-bias and calibrated photodiodes (818 series, Newport). SEM characterizations were performed on Zeiss Leo 1530 field-emission microscope and TEM measurements were conducted on FEI TF30. X-ray diffraction pattern were acquired from the Bruker D8 Discovery with Cu KR radiation.\n",
      "In this work, through combining spin-coating SnO2 nanocrystal solutions with hydrothermal treatment, we have developed a novel, low-cost process to fabricate high-quality SnO2 ETLs at temperatures as low as 100 C. The performance of the SnO2 on a rigid ITO/glass substrate show that the quality of the 100 C hydrothermally treated SnO2 ETL is better than that of the 150 C annealed SnO2 ETL. This may be due to two major reasons: i) hot water vapor promotes the complete removal of the organic surfactants coated on the surface of the SnO2 nanoparticles, resulting in the formation of a ligand-free SnO2 ETL; ii) the high vapor pressure of water can make the SnO2 nanoparticles denser by grain squeezing and improve the connectivity between the grain boundaries, leading to a high degree of crystallization and decreased resistivity of the SnO2 ETL. Additionally, this novel process was used to fabricate SnO2 ETLs on flexible ITO/PEN substrates and obtained flexible PSC devices with an excellent PCE of 18.1% and a certified efficiency of 17.3%, which may be the highest certified PCE of all reported flexible PSCs. Because of the extremely wide applicability and low cost of the hydrothermal treatment, this strategy can be expediently used to fabricate various inorganic ETLs on flexible substrates and for the mass production of flexible PSC devices.\n",
      "In summary, we proposed a simple hydrothermal treatment to obtain high-quality and ligand-free SnO2 ETLs (HT-SnO2). The electrical conductivity and charge transport ability of SnO2, which was deposited from a colloidal SnO2 solution, can be effectively improved by hydrothermal treatment. Furthermore, the processing temperature has been decreased to 100 C, and the PSCs based on these HT-SnO2 ETLs exhibit a higher VOC and FF and a lower JV hysteresis than those based on conventional thermally annealed SnO2. Benefiting from the low temperature of the hydrothermal treatment, the excellent flexible PSCs exhibit PCE values of 18.09% and 17.37%, as measured from reverse and forward scans, respectively. In addition, a stabilized efficiency of over 17% can be achieved 1807604 (8 of 10) by HT-SnO2. Furthermore, the certified efficiency of the flexible PSCs reached 17.27%, which is the highest certified value to be reported for flexible PSCs. The enhanced performance of the PSCs can be attributed to the large grain sizes of the perovskite based on HT-SnO2, low trap density of the device, high charge transport efficiency of HT-SnO 2, and the more energy band matching between HT-SnO2 and the perovskite layer. In addition, both rigid PSCs and flexible PSCs exhibit excellent stability. This novel approach is universally applicable and practical for producing other inorganic ETLs for perovskite solar cells.\n",

      "Fabrication of AD-SnO2, TA-SnO2, and HT-SnO2 films: The colloidal SnO2 aqueous dispersion (15 wt%) was diluted using deionized water to 5 wt%. This solution was stirred at room temperature for 2 h. The AD-SnO2 ETLs were fabricated by spin-coating the above SnO2 solution at 4000 rpm for 30 s. For the TA-SnO2 film, the AD-SnO 2 iflm was annealed on a 150  C hot plate for 60 min to remove the residual solvent and surfactant. For the HT-SnO2, the AD-SnO2 film was transferred to a 25 mL Teflon-lined stainless-steel autoclave with 10 mL of water and then heated to 100 C for 1 h. For the flexible PSC device, the ITO/PEN substrate was first spin-coated with a 1 mg mL 1 solution of CPTA in DMF at 4000 rpm for 30 s at ambient temperature to increase the hydrophilicity of the flexible substrate.

      "Device Fabrication: The perovskite layer was deposited onto different ETL substrates using a one-step solution process. A perovskite precursor solution was prepared and consisted of 172 mg of FAI, 507 mg of PbI2, 22.4 mg of MABr, and 73.4 mg of PbBr2 dissolved in 1 mL of a mixed solvent comprising DMF and DMSO at a volume ratio of 9:1. Then, a stock solution of 1.5 m CsI in DMSO was added to the mixed perovskite precursor solution to obtain the Cs0.05FA0.81MA0.14PbI2.55Br0.45 precursor solution. Before deposition of the perovskite absorbing layer, the SnO2 substrates were treated with UVOzone (UVO) for 10 min. The perovskite films were deposited onto the SnO2 substrates via a two-step spin-coating procedure. The ifrst step was performed at 1000 rpm for 10 s with an acceleration of 500 rpm s1. The second step was performed at 4000 rpm for 35 s with an acceleration of 2000 rpm s1. Chlorobenzene (100  L) was quickly added onto the spinning substrate during the second spin-coating step 15 s before the end of the procedure. Afterward, the as-prepared iflms were heated at 100  C for 1 h until their color had changed to dark red. The hole-transport layer (HTL) was prepared by spin-coating a Spiro-OMeTAD solution. The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving Spiro-OMeTAD at a concentration of 72.3 mg mL1 in a chlorobenzene solution that contained 30  L mL1 tBP and 20  L mL1 Li-TFSI salt (520 mg mL1 in acetonitrile). Finally, a 100 nm thick Au layer was thermally evaporated at a rate of 0.05 nm s1 under a pressure of 4  105 Torr to complete the device fabrication.\n",
      "Measurements and Characterization: UVvis absorption spectra were recorded using a Perkin Elmer Lambda 950 UVvisNIR spectrometer. The photoluminescence (PL) spectra were acquired using a Horiba Fluoromax-4 spectrouflorometer. The time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) spectra were measured with an Edinburgh Instrument FLS980 using 375 nm excitation derived from an Nd:YAG laser. FTIR spectral data for the devices were collected over the 7003600 cm1 range by using a Nicolet NEXUS 870 FTIR spectrometer. Drop shape analysis was performed using a drop shape analyser (AST VCA Optima XE) with 18 M water and a 4  L dispersed volume.

      "In this work, we explore the impact of light-soaking individual MAPbI3 grains in polycrystalline films while immersing them with different atmospheric treatments. We use in situ micro-PL measurements to show that the response of each grain to continuous illumination depends sensitively on both the atmospheric environment and the nature of the specific grain, i.e., whether it shows good (bright grain) or poor (dark grain) luminescence properties. We find that both bright and dark grains show a small decrease in emission intensity under illumination over time in dry nitrogen. If they are instead illuminated in the presence of oxygen or moisture, the emission from the more defect-rich dark grain rises substantially, while the emission from the less-defective bright grain is constant.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have used confocal photoluminescence measurements to show that the PL properties of MAPbI3 perovskite grains under continual illumination depend sensitively on the type of grain (bright or dark) and type of adsorbed molecules. We find that dark grains show substantial enhancements under illumination in the presence of oxygen and/or water molecules, while bright grains show less of an effect.\n",

      "In this study, we have introduced an efficient pristine HTM, tetrathiafulvalene derivative (TTF-1), into perovskite solar cells, without the use of p-type dopants. As compared to cells based on well-known p-type doped spiro-OMeTAD, perovskite solar cells based on dopant-free TTF-1 performed with a comparable efficiency of 11.03%; more importantly, the stability of the dopant-free TTF-1 based cell was greatly improved two fold in air at a relative humidity of 40%. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst case of perovskite solar cells employing a dopant-free HTM based on a tetrathiafulvalene derivative yielding an efficiency over 11%. The present nding paves the way for the development of efficient dopant-free HTMs for perovskite solar cells, which promotes the advancement of costeffective and practical perovskite solar cells. in hole transportation and the retardation of charge recombination.1820 So far, HTMs in perovskite solar cells mainly involve nitrogen-containing donors1825 such as 2,20,7,70-tetrakis-(N,N-di-pmethoxyphenylamine)-9,90-spiro-biuorene (spiro-OMeTAD), poly-(triarylamine) (PTAA),26 and so on. Due to the sp3 hybridization of the nitrogen atom, the inherent triangular pyramid conguration leads to large intermolecular distances, thus they suffer from low hole mobility, low conductivity, or both, in their pristine form.27,28 Therefore, redox active p-type dopants, such as Li-bis(triuoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI), have been commonly adopted to increase the conductivity and thereby improve cell performance.2931 However, such dopants have aggravated cell performance degradation due to their deliquescent behaviour (Fig. S1), and the additional doping materials and doping process increase costs. Moreover, the p-type doping strategy requires strict optimization of the doping conditions (e.g., the solvent, dopants and doping concentrations). In this regard, .\n",

      "In summary, TTF-1, a member of the tetrathiafulvalene family, has been shown, for the rst time, to be a promising HTM candidate for perovskite solar cells without using lithium salts and TBP. To the best of our knowledge, this is the rst case of perovskite solar cells employing a dopant-free HTM based on a tetrathiafulvalene derivative yielding an efficiency over 11%, which is comparable with that obtained using the well-known ptype doped spiro-OMeTAD; moreover, the stability of the dopant-free TTF-1 based cells was greatly improved two fold in air at a common relative humidity of 40%. The present results show that TTF-1 is superior to spiro-OMeTAD and P3HT as a dopant-free HTM in these hybrid solar cells. The fact that a module (1 cm 1 cm) based on dopant-free TTF-1 yielded an efficiency over 8% highlights its potential application in perovskite solar cells. The feasibility of tailoring the structure and tuning the properties of TTF derivatives guarantees their bright future as dopant-free HTMs in perovskite solar cells.\n",

Work on these, and systematic investigation of the effect of long alkyl chains on cell performance and stability, is now in progress.\n",
      "Based on our device results shown above, the FF is the major efficiency limitation. The use of a localized diffusion could significantly reduce the contact resistivity and improve the FF of the c-Si bottom cell. However, for the perovskite top cell, the reason for the low FF is still unknown and requires further research. With a more reasonable FF (0.78), the power conversion efficiency for the tandem cell could be further boosted to exceed 29%, well beyond the current record for single junction c-Si cells.\n",
      "We have demonstrated a new homojunction c-Si cell architecture suitable for perovskite-silicon tandems. This structure allows high temperature processed compact and mesoporous TiOx layers to be used for the perovskite cell while allowing passivation layers on both sides of the c-Si subcell, thus maintaining a high Voc for the c-Si subcell. We carefully studied and optimised the optical and passivating properties of these passivation layers. A modified vacuum flash technique was introduced for the deposition of large area, quadruple cation perovskite films with good yield and high efficiency. These innovations enabled the realisation of a 22.5% efficient monolithic tandem device. We identify key areas for further performance improvement that provide a path for the realisation of cell efficiencies beyond 29%.\n",
      "Fabrication of the c-Si cell starts with a 5-Ohm cm n-type FZ wafer, chemically polished on both sides. It goes through a 1050 1C dry oxidation first to grow a thick SiO2 on both sides of the wafer. Then we use photolithography to define the active region (1 cm2, boron emitter) at the front side of the wafer and put the wafer in buffered HF solution to etch off the oxide layer. Wafers are then transferred to the Tempress furnace for boron diffusion at 930 1C, with 25 min deposition and 20 min oxidation. This is followed by removal of the rear-side oxide, texturing, then back-to-back POCl3 diffusion at 780 1C for 30 min. Next we remove the front side borosilicate glass and rear side phosphosilicate glass using a HF dip. Front side passivation is carried out with plasma-assisted atomic layer deposition Al2O3 (20 nm)36 followed by Plasma-enhanced chemical vapor deposition (PECVD) SiNx, (RI B 2.9, 50 nm thick). The textured rear side is then passivated with standard PECVD SiNx (RI B 1.9, 70 nm thick). Photolithography is used to define the contact opening for both sides of the wafer, followed by a reactive ion etch (RIE). A buffered HF dip is then used to remove the passivation layers in the contact regions. The Cr/Pd/Ag metal stack was thermally evaporated on both sides of the wafer, then lifted off with acetone in an ultrasonic bath. The rear side Ag (100 nm)/Al (800 nm) contact capping layer was evaporated through a shadow mask onto the active region only (1 cm2).

      "In this work, we use temperature-dependent time-resolved photoluminescence (TRPL) and microwave conductance (TRMC) techniques to study the dynamics of optically excited charge carriers in CH3NH3PbI3 at charge densities comparable to AM 1.5 excitation (see Fig. 1). Both techniques show that second-order electron hole recombination is a thermally activated process for T > 160 K (refs 7,19). These results are explained by proposing that photoexcited carriers undergo a phonon-assisted recombination pathway. In the orthorhombic phase (T < 160 K), fast quenching of mobile charges is observed. Finally, we find that this behaviour is general for solution-processed perovskite films with a planar or mesostructured morphology, independent of the lead precursor used in the fabrication.\n",
      "To briefly summarize our results: at 300 K, the generation yield of free charge carriers in CH3NH3PbI3 is 20% higher for excitation just above the bandgap (at 1.7 eV) than further above the bandgap (>1.8 eV). Furthermore, in the tetragonal phase, an energetic barrier exists for second-order band-to-band recombination between mobile CB electrons and VB holes. In the orthorhombic phase, both excitons and free charges decay via fast non-radiative recombination pathways, which competes e ectively with charge carrier generation.\n",
      "Optical characterization. Absorption and transmission spectra were recorded with a Perkin-Elmer Lambda 1050 spectrophotometer equipped with an integrated sphere. The thin films were placed in front of the sphere to measure the fraction of transmitted light (FT) and under an angle of 10 inside the sphere to detect the total fraction of reflected and transmitted photons (FRCT). From here, we calculated the fraction of absorbed light (FA): The fraction of reflected light (FR) was determined from: FA D 1\n",

      "The low-temperature transmission spectrum was measured under nitrogen using a Cary 500i UV-Vis-NIR Dual-Beam Spectrophotometer with a liquid-nitrogen-cooled Linkum Scientific FTIR 600 Freezing stage for temperature control. FA was calculated from (2), thereby neglecting possible temperature dependence of FR. For the temperature-dependent TRPL measurements the samples were placed in a nitrogen-filled cryostat. The PL emission spectra and PL lifetimes at the maximum emission wavelength were recorded using an Edinburgh LifeSpec spectrometer equipped with a single-photon counter.

      "In light of the above, in the present work we employ SnOx grown by ALD for a twofold purpose: (i) as protection layer for the ultrathin metal layer as part of a semitransparent ITO-free bottom electrode and (ii) as concomitant electron extraction layer in a conventional planar PVSC. ALD in general relies on the sequential delivery of a metal-organic precursor and an oxidant. In the case of our SnOx the oxidant can be water (H2OSnOx), ozone (ozone-SnOx), or oxygen plasma (plasma-SnOx).\n",

The best characteristics were achieved for devices based on ozone-SnOx as EEL with a stable PCE of 15.3% and a remarkably high Voc of 1.17 V. Photoelectron spectroscopy revealed the formation of a PbI2 interfacial layer between the SnOx and the perovskite in all devices. Different interface dipoles between PbI2 and SnOx grown with different oxidants resulted in different electron extraction barriers in the CB between the MAPbI3 and the PbI2.\n",

In the following, these samples are abbreviated as the spiro-OMeTAD thin film and the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD layered film, respectively, which were fabricated following the literatures.8,19 All samples were naturally oxidized under ambient air conditions outside the glove box after the fabrication. The details of the fabrication process are described in supplementary material. The fabricated samples were sealed in an ESR sample tube with helium gas at 100 Torr after evacuating the tube below 6 10 4 Pa. Only the spiroOMeTAD thin film without Li-TFSI was sealed in a nitrogen-filled glove box. The ESR measurements were carried out with a JEOL RESONANCE JES-FA200 X-band spectrometer under dark conditions or simulated solar irradiation using a Bunkoukeiki OTENTOSUN-150LX solar simulator at room temperature. The number of spins, the g value, and the linewidth of the ESR signals were calibrated using a standard Mn2 marker sample.\n",
      "In summary, we performed the ESR study of the spiroOMeTAD thin films and the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD layered films, where spiro-OMeTAD were undoped or doped with Li-TFSI, and analyzed the states of long-lived charges in the materials from a microscopic viewpoint. For the spiroOMeTAD thin films, the dramatic increase in the ESR signal due to the hole formation in spiro-OMeTAD was observed by the Li-TFSI doping. The increase in the doping effects was also observed under simulated solar irradiation. For the perovskite/spiro-OMeTAD (with Li-TFSI) layered films, the increase in the number of the long-lived holes was observed under the light irradiation, which showed the increase in the ratio of the mobile long-lived holes. The remained holes after turning off the light irradiation were ascribed to the increase in the Li-TFSI doping effects under the light irradiation. Thus, the variation of the charge states in the perovskite solar-cell materials under the light irradiation is demonstrated by the ESR analysis at a molecular level. Such knowledge would be important for understanding of the device operation and the deterioration mechanism of the perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "MBCP-Al2O3 Perovskite Solar Cell Performance. Figure 5 shows SEM images of MBCP-Al2O3 perovskite films prepared from 40 wt % precursor solutions and annealed either instantaneously at 100 C (ITD), or with a slow temperature ramp to 100 C (TTD) in nitrogen. While the crystallite domain sizes are very similar for the ITD and TTD annealed films (Figure 5c,d), the capping film coverage is drastically different. Figure 5a shows that large pores (>1 m) were formed in the capping layer of the MBCP-Al2O3 perovskite films annealed instantly at 100 C (ITD). In contrast, when the MBCP-Al2O3 perovskite film was annealed with a slow temperature ramp of 5 C/5 min in nitrogen to 100 C and held for 45 min at the final temperature (TTD), significantly better perovskite film coverage was achieved. The 40 wt % perovskite film morphology is highly similar to the 20 wt % perovskite films (Figure S4, Supporting Information). We hypothesize that the crystalline precursor, which is present for a longer dwell period during TTD annealing, promotes film formation with fewer macroscopic defects than in ITD annealed films.\n",

At the same time, the power conversion efficiency increased from 5.2 to 8.3%.

      "Jumping rotational modes of [CH3NH3]  . CH3NH3PbI3 crystallizes in the common perovskite structure where the organic cation [CH3NH3]  occupies the centre of the PbI6 octahedral cage, as shown in Fig. 1a. Neutron and X-ray powder diffraction investigations suggest that it undergoes successive phase transitions, from cubic (Pm3m) to tetragonal (I4/mcm) at 330 K, and then to orthorhombic (Pnma) at 165 K (refs 28,29). Our single crystal exhibits a sharp phase transition between 160 and 165 K, as shown in Supplementary Fig. 2, which is in agreement with these reports. While it is believed that this transition is coupled with orientation of [CH3NH3]  , current reports on rotational dynamics are contradictory30,31, probably owing to the lack of results on single crystals. Given that this compound is extremely sensitive to ambient conditions32,33, measurements on a single crystal (with minimized surface contribution) are anticipated to deliver more intrinsic information. Here, the accurate jumping rotational dynamics of molecules is obtained by performing ultrahigh energy resolution QENS measurements on the large single crystal at the backscattering neutron spectrometer, DNA.\n",

The characteristic timescales of various dynamics are completely revealed. The dipole order of organic cations plays a decisive role in determining the physical properties such as carrier mobility and thermal conduction, distinguishing from inorganic perovskites. Such observations are probably general for all hybrid compounds with polar molecules. These fundamental insights are beneficial to further study of perovskite solar cells.\n",

MD simulations were performed using the massively parallelized LAMMPS package65 and the recently developed classical MYP force field34, which reasonably reproduces the physical properties of CH3NH3PbI3 (refs 38,66,67). In such a force field, non-bonded pairwise interactions are described by the sum of Buckingham, Lennard-Jones and long-range electrostatic potentials. Intra- and inter-molecular interactions of organic cations CH3NH3 are described by the AMBER force field68. The cut-off distances for all the interactions are chosen to be 10 . A time step of 0.5 fs was used in all simulations.

      "A major efficiency limit for solution-processed perovskite optoelectronic devices, for example light-emitting diodes, is trapmediated non-radiative losses. Defect passivation using organic molecules has been identified as an attractive approach to tackle this issue. However, implementation of this approach has been hindered by a lack of deep understanding of how the molecular structures influence the effectiveness of passivation. We show that the so far largely ignored hydrogen bonds play a critical role in affecting the passivation. By weakening the hydrogen bonding between the passivating functional moieties and the organic cation featuring in the perovskite, we significantly enhance the interaction with defect sites and minimize non-radiative recombination losses. Consequently, we achieve exceptionally high-performance near-infrared perovskite light-emitting diodes with a record external quantum efficiency of 21.6%. In addition, our passivated perovskite light-emitting diodes maintain a high external quantum efficiency of 20.1% and a wall-plug efficiency of 11.0% at a high current density of 200mAcm2, making them more attractive than the most efficient organic and quantum-dot light-emitting diodes at high excitations.\n",
      "Perovskite film characterization and device performance. Amino groups have been frequently employed to passivate perovskite semiconductors due to their coordination bonding to unsaturated PbI6-octahedral20. Here, we select two similar amino-functionalized PAsthat is, 2,2-(ethylenedioxy)diethylamine (EDEA) and hexamethylenediamine (HMDA) (Fig. 1a), which have identical length of alkyl chains; the difference is that EDEA has two additional O atoms within the chain. We perform first-principles calculations to demonstrate that both of them can help to passivate the surface iodide vacancy (VI) through PbN coordination bonding, and thus show the potential to improve the EL performance (Supplementary Figs. 1 and 2). The formamidinium lead tri-iodide (FAPbI3) perovskite layers are deposited by spin-casting the precursors with a molar ratio of PbI2: formamidinium iodide (FAI): PA = 1: 2: x (x = 0~0.3), where an FAI excess is used to eliminate the non-perovskite -phase (Supplementary Fig. 3)23. We fabricate PeLEDs with the device architecture of indium tin oxide (ITO)/polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE): modified zinc oxide nanocrystals (ZnO:PEIE)/perovskite/ poly(9,9-dioctyl-fluorene-co-N-(4-butylphenyl)diphenyl-amine) (TFB)/molybdenum oxide (MoO3)/Au, as depicted in the highangle annular dark-field scanning transmission electron microscope (HAADF-STEM) cross-sectional images in Fig. 1b. Both HAADF-STEM and scanning electron microscope (SEM) images (Supplementary Fig. 4) show the formation of separated nanoisland features in the perovskite emissive layer. These nano-island features have not resulted in strong leakage currents (Fig. 1e), possibly due to the different TFB thickness on perovskite nano-islands and on ZnO:PEIE, as well as unfavourable charge injection from ZnO to TFB (Supplementary Fig. 5). All the devices show EL peaks at 800 nm/1.55 eV (Fig. 1c) and low turn-on voltages around 1.25 V (see Supplementary Fig. 6 for the characterization set-up), where the measurements were performed in a N2-filled glovebox. In spite of the small difference between the chemical structures of EDEA and HMDA, we notice a significant difference in the EQE values of the devices treated with these two PAs (Fig. 1d). The peak EQE is 10.9% for the HMDA-treated devices and 17.9% for the EDEAtreated ones. The EDEA-treated devices show high efficiencies even if we make significant changes to the emissive layer morphologies (Supplementary Figs. 7 and 8), indicating that the difference in the device performance of HMDA- and EDEA-treated devices results from the different intrinsic passivation effects of these two PAs.\n",

      "In summary, we have demonstrated high-efficiency near-infrared PeLEDs with a peak EQE of 21.6%, which represents the most efficient PeLEDs to date. Our devices also show low-efficiency rolloff, maintaining a high EQE of 20.1% and a wall-plug efficiency of 11.0% at a high current density of 200 mA cm2. Our results indicate a unique opportunity for PeLEDs to achieve solution-processed large-scale LEDs with high efficiencies at high brightness. The high efficiencies stem from our deep understanding of the passivation mechanisms of perovskites by organic molecules. We reveal the critical role of hydrogen bonds in influencing the passivation effects. By weakening the hydrogen bonding between the passivating functional groups and the organic cations of perovskites, we significantly reduce the non-radiative recombination. Our findings provide a broad avenue to explore the potential of molecular passivation for improving various perovskite applications where nonradiative losses should be minimized. online content Any methods, additional references, Nature Research reporting summaries, source data, statements of data availability and associated accession codes are available at https://doi.org/10.1038/ s41566-019-0390-x.\n",
      "Preparation of the perovskite solution. Perovskite precursors (FAI: PbI2: PA molar ratio of 2: 1: x, x = 00.3) were prepared with dimethylformamide (DMF) as the solvent. A 10 mg ml1 PA solution was prepared at first, and then was diluted according to the required molar ratio to Pb2+. The optimal concentration for PbI2 was 0.13 M. The solution precursors were stirred at 50C for 12 h before spincoating. Colloidal ZnO nanocrystal was synthesized by a solutionprecipitation process, the details of which can be found in the literature39.\n",
      "PeLED fabrication. The indium tin oxide (ITO) glass substrates were sequentially cleaned by detergent and TL-1 (a mixture of water, ammonia (25%) and hydrogen peroxide (28%) (5:1:1 by volume)). The clean substrates were then treated by ultraviolet-ozone for 10 min. The ZnO nanocrystal solutions were spin-cast onto the substrates at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s in air. Then the substrates were moved into a N2filled glovebox. Next, a layer of polyethylenimine ethoxylated (PEIE) was deposited at 5,000 r.p.m. (0.05 wt%, in IPA), followed by annealing at 100 C for 10 min. After cooling down to room temperature, the perovskite films were deposited from the precursors with various PA contents and Pb2+ concentrations at a spin-coating speed of 3,000 r.p.m., followed by annealing at 100 C for 10 min. For the control perovskite films prepared by anti-solvent treatment, the spin-casting rate is 5,000 r.p.m. In addition, 150 l chlorobenzene (CB) was dropped after 5 s spinning. The TFB layer was deposited from its CB solution (12 mg ml1) at 3,000 r.p.m. Finally, the MoOx/Au electrode was deposited by a thermal evaporation system through a shadow mask under a base pressure of 1  107 torr. The device area was 7.25 mm2, as defined by the overlapping area of the ITO films and top electrodes.\n",
      "PeLED characterization. All PeLED device characterizations were carried out at room temperature in a nitrogen-filled glovebox. A Keithley 2400 sourcemeter and a fibre integration sphere (FOIS-1) coupled with a QE Pro spectrometer (Ocean Optics) were used for the measurements. The PeLED devices are tested on top of the integration sphere and only forward light emission can be collected, consistent with the standard OLED characterization method. The absolute radiance was calibrated by a standard VisNIR light source (HL-3P-INT-CAL plus, Ocean Optics). The devices were swept from zero bias to forward bias. The time evolution of the EQE was measured using the same testing system. To verify the accuracy of our characterization set-up, we crosschecked our results at Nanjing Tech University. The performances obtained in the two laboratories are in good agreement (Supplementary Table 2).\n",

Steady-state PL spectra of the perovskite films were recorded by means of a fluorescent spectrophotometer (F-4600, HITACHI) with a 200 W Xe lamp as an excitation source. Absorption spectra were measured with a PerkinElmer model Lambda 900. The XRD patterns, UV and PL spectra for DDDA-, ODEA- and TTDDA-treated perovskite films are shown in Supplementary Figs. 16 and 17. Similarly, we find no evidence for the formation of low-dimensional perovskite within the resulting films from XRD, UV and PL measurements.

      "Comparison of the long-range charge carrier mobility within different perovskite films prepared via different deposition methodologies The long-range mobility that we have estimated above is for MAPbI3 films processed from the acetonitrile/methylamine mixed solvent system. However, there are many other processing routes and perovskite compositions used in the research community. Here, we assess if the long-range charge carrier mobility of the perovskite layer is strongly influenced by the thin film processing methodology. To investigate this, and to assess the applicability of our technique to a broader set of materials, we prepared perovskite films using different fabrication processes, which are representative of state of the art perovskite absorbers used in the research community; CH3NH3PbI3 films from thermal co-evaporation (termed MA-evap),48 Cs0.17FA0.83 Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 (termed, FACs),2,49 and Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95 Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 (termed FAMACs)2,49,50 (see experimental section for the respective deposition procedures).\n",
      "In conclusion, we have presented a new method for determining the long-range lateral charge carrier mobility within perovskite films by quasi-steady-state optoelectronic techniques. By modeling the photo-induced sub-bandgap changes in the complex refractive index, obtained via photo-induced transmission and reflection (PITR) measurements, we determine the charge carrier density and combine it with the quasi-steadystate photo-conductivity. We evaluate the long-range lateral mobility of MAPbI3, Cs0.17FA0.83Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3, Cs0.05(FA0.83MA0.17)0.95Pb(I0.9Br0.1)3 as a function of free carrier density, and determine mobilities ranging from 2.2 down to 0.2 cm2 V 1 s 1 depending upon the preparation route and charge carrier density. Despite many years of intense research, to the best of our knowledge, our results represent the first accurate evaluation of the long-range lateral mobility in lead tri-halide perovskite films, and also highlight key advantages of quasi-steady-state method performed under similar excitation densities to a working solar cell. We believe that our technique will help to bring us closer to a complete understanding of long-range charge transport in different metal halide perovskite compounds, and other semiconductors, and gives us a new handle with which to examine and improve perovskite semiconductors.\n",

The solution mixture was then stirred overnight at 60 C, percolated by a syringe filter (Whatman, 0.45 m) and diluted to 0.025 mol/L. An upturned 50 mL beaker was placed into a 250 mL beaker containing 75 mL of dichloromethane (DCM). A Petri dish with diameter of 7.5 cm containing glass and SiO2/Ag substrates (size: 10  10 mm2) located on top of the 50 mL beaker. The glass and SiO2/Ag substrates were wiped by hydrophobic polyethylene in advance. Fifteen microliters of MAPbBr3/DMF solution was dropped onto the center of the substrates and uniformly dispersed on the substrates. The whole experimental facility was sealed by a piece of tinfoil for 24 h, followed by collection of as-prepared NWs on substrates. Ag film was prepared by using a thermal evaporator. SiO2 film with different thicknesses (5, 10, and 20 nm) were deposited onto the Ag film by magnetron sputtering. The surface morphology of the Ag film after deposition of SiO2 is measured by atomic force microscope (AFM) (Figure S4).\n",
      "Perovskite-based solar cells have emerged as a promising technology for highly efficient and low-cost photovoltaics. The high efficiencies so far reported that go beyond 20% have been fabricated by using high temperature mesoporous thin layers (ca. 200 nm) infiltrated and capped (ca. 500 nm composed of large crystals) by a tailored-ion Pb-based perovskite material. Mesoporous-free planar perovskite solar cells (achieving up to 19.6%) have struggled to keep up with the progress of the mesoporous counter parts. Our work shows that efficiencies close to 21% are possible for the planar configuration, by a simple, low temperature, solution processed SnO2 method with suitable energetics and the additional advantage of improvements in series resistance at the electron selective layer/perovskite interface. In addition, the solar cells show great stability under 1 sun illumination and constant maximum power point tracking. Therefore, the newly proposed approach represents an important contribution on the way towards industrialization of perovskite photovoltaics that can withstand sustained operation under working conditions. the photovoltaic field. The general formula of the commonly used perovskite is ABX3 containing an organic cation A, such as methylammonium (MA) or formamidinium (FA),1,3 a divalent metal B, such as Pb or Sn,4 and a halide X, such as Br or I. Perovskite materials can be processed by a large number of techniques, mostly low temperature, solution-based, and therefore they are ideal for commercialization. These techniques are comprised of spin coating,5 dip coating,6 2-step interdiffusion,7 thermal evaporation,8,9 and vacuum-induced crystallization.10 The impressive performances achieved to date have been attributed to exceptional material properties such as low charge recombination, high light absorption over the visible spectrum and charge carrier diffusion lengths in the micrometre range.1113\n",
      "Here, we report highly efficient planar perovskite solar cells based on SnO2 electron selective layers prepared through a simple solution-processing method, reaching a PCE close to 21% which is the highest efficiency for any planar configuration reported to date. Briefly, our chemical bath deposition (CBD) yields SnO2 films in short times, resulting in blocking layers with high selectivity supporting the highest reported voltages so far of 1214 mV (at a band gap of 1.62 eV).24 In addition to high voltages, this new method showed high fill factors which is key to matching the efficiencies of the high-temperature, mesoporous counterparts. In addition, PSCs prepared with this facile method showed great stability retaining more than 82% of the initial efficiency over 60 hours. Remarkably, the devices showed a final PCE of 20.7% after ageing and several hours of dark, dry air storage, being higher than the initial pre-aged measurement of 20.4%. This novel deposition method represents a breakthrough as it opens up a scalable and inexpensive way to deposit high-quality SnO2 electron selective contacts for remarkably stable PSCs with efficiencies close to 21%.\n",
      "Results and discussion Schematics of the simple, low temperature, solution processed methods are shown in Fig. 1. The two methods and combinations of them were used to understand their homogeneous blocking properties. The first method is comprised of spin coating (SC) of a SnCl4 precursor solution in isopropyl alcohol, as shown by Ke et al.25 and depicted in Fig. 1a. In a second method a combination of SnO2 SC and a post-treatment chemical bath deposition (SC-CBD),26 as shown in Fig. 1b, was used to improve the conformality and thus blocking capabilities of the SnO2 layer, important for shunt-free PSCs. The layers were further optimized by modifying the solution concentration. More details can be found in ESI, note 1.\n",

Top-view scanning electron micrographs (SEM) of the different layers are shown in Fig. 1ce. ALD layers (Fig. 1c) exhibit no clear features compared to the FTO substrate (Fig. S1f, ESI), due to the conformal nature of this deposition method. The SnO2 layers by SC and SC-CBD, presented in Fig. 1d and e, display a clear change in the morphology of the substrate, indicating a rougher surface than the ALD-deposited controls. The typical cassiterite SnO2 structure is detectable for all thin films in the XRD patterns in Fig. S2 (ESI). X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS, Fig. S3, ESI) exhibits the survey of elements and the high resolution of Sn and O confirms the formation of pure SnO2 observing the oxygen peak O 1s at 531.0 eV and Sn4+ peaks at 495.3 eV as well as at 487.0 eV. .\n",

Its dimensions are 6.0(x)  2.6(y)  3.0(z) mm3 and it has a pale green hue (with an absorption of 2 cm1 in the visible) caused by a small component of Cu impurities. The unit cell manifests random substitutions, a compositional disorder that, as a consequence of the structural flexibility typical of perovskites, leads to locally modified polarizabilities and temperaturedependent nanoscale dipolar structures (nanodisordered ferroelectricity). The result is a modified ferroelectric behaviour dominated by so-called polar nanoregions (PNRs), characterized by dielectric dispersion and out-of-equilibrium behaviour (relaxor ferroelectricity)7,8. In the present case, this disorder is itself not homogeneous, manifesting a spatially periodic micrometric oscillation along a specific crystal axis. This is because the sample is grown into a bulk through the top-seeded method, a technique that entails a slight time oscillation in the temperature of the solidifying melt that, in turn, translates into a characteristic periodic pattern along the growth (or pull) axis. This pattern conditions the nanoscale dipolar structures, which, at the room-temperature Curie point (Tc = 288 K), form a three-dimensional mesh of spontaneous polarization, the super-crystal13,14. We note that samples of KTN:Li can be grown as films and thin films using vapour deposition or can be tailored into waveguides using ion amorphization.

Light is collected using a high-aperture long-working distance microscope objective (OBJ, Edmund Optics, 100, 3 mm working distanc, achromatic, NA = 0.8) positioned ~30 cm from the output lens of the projector. An important parameter in experiments is the rotation angle of the KTN:Li sample around the vertical y axis, 1 (Fig.1c), that is, the angle between the normal to the sample input facet (z) and the experiment propagation axis (z). Images and movies are obtained using an Apple iPhone7 either directly or through one eyepiece of a high-aperture optical microscope (Nikon, NA = 0.8) positioned on top of the sample, along the y axis. Higher-resolution images are achieved by placing in the eyepiece a high-resolution black-and-white charged-coupled device (CCD) (PCO Pixelfly, 14 bit, 1,392  1,060 pixels). Transmitted light is collected by an imaging lens with NA = 0.35 and focal length of 75 mm. This lens forms an image of a desired plane onto the front-view CCD (Thorlabs BC-106VIS, 12 bit). Sample temperature is fixed by a current-controlled Peltier junction and is positioned and rotated using micrometric stages. White-light GR Part 1. For T = Tc, a distinct white beam forms that extends from the input of the sample to the output (Fig.1e). This beam propagates with 2 = 0, is white, and does not spread, even though it originates from a white incoherent focused spot from the microscope objective. The GR beam forms as a consequence of thermalizing the crystal to Tc, as can be appreciated in Fig.1f, where the sample originally at 303 K is brought to T = Tc and progressively thermalizes in time. Intervals of time measure the delay between the moment when the image is captured and the moment when the sensor measuring the temperature of the sample first reaches Tc. A cooling experiment is reported in Supplementary Video 1. The phenomenon depends solely on T and is independent of beam intensity, size, launch angle 1 and position in the sample. A scan of position and angle is provided in Supplementary Videos2 and 3. As expected, GR also occurs when the white-light is focused before and after the input facet, but with a correspondingly larger width in the GR component. Specifically, in Fig.1f, the focus is formed inside the sample and, as the GR regime emerges, the actual focus disappears and leads to a slightly enlarged GR transmission. This same effect can be appreciated in Supplementary Videos13, where a focus in front and inside the sample are studied. The GR beam does not manifest chromatic dispersion that can, in turn, be directly observed in conventional scattering from the crystal support, as reported in Fig.1g. White-light GR Part 2. Examples of higher-resolution images of the effect are reported in Fig.2a,c. Figure2a reports the GR effect as the sample is kept at the ferroelectric Curie point, while Fig.2b reports the phenomenon when the sample is kept at a lower temperature (Tc  3 K). Compared to the GR case, increased scattering causes light to decay along the normal to the input facet. Enhanced scattering appears in the path of the beam. At this same temperature, light polarized in the orthogonal TE mode also undergoes GR, along with a similar scattering (Fig.2c). The intensity of the scattered light, as deduced from the scattered intensity, is reported in Fig.2d (background noise has been subtracted). Orange squares refer to data from the T = Tc GR and indicate an exponential decay with a decay rate of 3.8 cm1, while blue and green curves refer, respectively, to the TM and TE modes at T = Tc  3 K, with a decay rate of 11.2 cm1. Front images of the projector light are reported in Fig.2e at the input and output at T = Tc + 15 K and T = Tc. Light is focused to a 52 m spot, and the sample is rotated by an angle of 1 = 35. When GR emerges, the output FWHM is 35 m, while without GR the FWHM is larger than 142 m, as the output diffraction image is a convolution of the actual spread out beam with the limited optical transfer function of the output imaging lens. Highresolution images of the relaxation at Tc are presented inSupplementary Fig.2. Laser-light GR. Laser light experiments were carried out using a 5 mW HeNe laser operating at  = 632.8 nm. For low-aperture experiments (Fig.3ce), the beam is first expanded using two confocal lenses to a plane-parallel 10-mm-radius beam. The beam is then focused using a 150-mm-focal-length lens onto the input facet of the sample. The beam NA is 0.1 (in air). The input beam has a FWHM of 18 m and is TM polarized. Top-view images were captured in a fashion similar to that used for white light (scattered light leads to an estimated monochromatic 632.8 nm decay rate along propagation, at TC, of 4.6 cm1 for the steady state of Fig.3e). In high-aperture experiments (Fig.3fh), the expanded laser is launched into the microscope objective (NA = 0.8). Experiments were carried out with 1 = 35, and the two reported sequences in Fig.3g,h differ in the actual position of the sample relative to the fixed input launch beam. In high-aperture experiments, the component not undergoing GR diffracts to 81 m, so that its intensity is too low to be detected when the GR component forms with its highly localized spots (Fig.3g,h).\n",
      "Surprisingly, the mixed perovskites with 10% Cs+ (i.e., Cs0.1(FA0.83MA0.17)0.9Pb(I0.83Br0.17)3) demonstrate a notably distinct crystallization process. In stage I, the precursor ring is observed at q  0.50 1, similar to the control system without Cs+ (Figure 2e). After the trigger of CB dropping (Figure 2f) to enter stage II (Figure 2g,h), the peak of the hexagonal 2H phase is significantly diminished, while the peaks of complex secondary phases observed in stage III of the control system are no longer detected. Instead, the perovskite -phase is quickly built up upon spinning (green and orange curves in Figure 2j). The findings suggest that Cs + could facilitate the formation of perovskite phase and simultaneously suppress other secondary phases. As summarized in the schematic of time axis (blue arrow in Figure 2), there exist three stages during the crystallization of the mixed-perovskite film without Cs +stage I: precursor solution; stage II: 2H phase; stage III: complex phases including hexagonal polytypes (4H, 6H), MAIPbI2DMSO 1901284 (3 of 10) intermediate phases, and perovskite -phase. In contrast, the mixed perovskite with Cs+ experiences only two stagesstage I: precursor solution; stage II: 2H and perovskite -phase.\n",
      "To correlate the diverse crystal formation pathways of perovskite films without or with Cs + with the device performance, we fabricated Csx(FA0.83MA0.17)1xPb(I0.83Br0.17)3 (x = 0 or 0.1) based PSCs using the one-step antisolvent process annealed at 100 C for 60 min with different spinning times (0, 15, 30, and 100 s) after the CB dropping. The device structure is FTO/SnO2/ mixed perovskite/Spiro-OMeTAD/Au (Figure S4a, Supporting Information). The JV curves and parameters of typical PSCs are shown in Figure S4b,c and Table S1 (Supporting Information). For PSCs without Cs+ (Figure 4a), decent device characteristics can be achieved for the films annealed at both 1901284 (5 of 10) 0 and 15 s. However, obvious device degradation is observed for lfims annealed with longer spinning time (30 and 100 s). In other words, the as-cast lfim is required to be annealed shortly after CB dropping and a delay of annealing will result in poor device performance. On the contrary, the PSCs with 10% Cs+ could achieve good performance regardless of spinning time (Figure 4b). Combining with in situ crystallization results, we posit that there exists an annealing window, spanning the duration of stage II. For the perovskite lfim without Cs + which undergoes three stages in the crystallization process, it is essential to anneal the lfim within the short period of stage II before entering stage III. For the perovskite lfim with Cs + which only experiences two stages, the annealing window is signicfiantly extended, reducing the time sensitivity of performing the annealing step to obtain a high-performance device.\n",
      "In summary, the crystallization pathways of mixed perovskites (FAPbI3)0.83(MAPbBr3)0.17 without and with Cs+ during spinning coating process have been revealed in great detail via in situ GIWAXS (Figure 6). The existence of annealing window has been recognized for the rfist time, which suggests that the as-cast lifm should be timely annealed within the annealing window to achieve a high-quality perovskite lfim.\n",
      "         Device Fabrication: FTO substrates were sequentially rinsed by sonication in detergent, deionized (DI) water, acetone and ethanol, and finally dried in air. Then, cleaned FTO substrates were treated with ultravioletozone for 15 min. The colloidal SnO2 quantum dot (QD) precursor solution was prepared according to the literature.[         \n",
      "Size-varied perovskite NC synthesis. MAPbBr3 NCs were synthesized by the ligand-assisted re-precipitation method as reported by Zhang et al.42. At first, in a glass vial, 0.16 mmol of methylammonium bromide (MABr) and 0.2 mmol of lead bromide (PbBr2) were mixed in 5 ml dimethylformamide (DMF) solution. Later, 50 ml of oleylamine and 0.5 ml oleic acid were also mixed in the DMF solution to form the final precursor solution. Another round-bottom flask containing 5 ml of toluene was preheated to 60 C in an oil bath. Then 250 ml of as-prepared precursor solution was swiftly injected into hot toluene solution under vigorous stirring condition. The solution immediately turned green, confirming the formation of MAPbBr3 NCs. The reaction was continued for another 5 min and stopped by cooling in a water bath. The reaction solution was transferred into a centrifuge tube and centrifuged at the desired speed for different sized spherical-shaped MAPbBr3 NCs. The precipitation of MAPbBr3 NCs was re-dissolved in toluene solution for further studies. For small-, medium- and large-sized NCs, the precipitate was separated by using centrifuge speed of 12,000, 8,000 and 4,000 r.p.m., respectively. The mean diameter are about 4.9, 8.9 and 11.6 nm for small-, medium- and largesized NCs, respectively (Supplementary Fig. 2).\n",
      "MAPbBr3 bulk-film fabrication. A solution containing 0.6 M MAPbBr3 in DMF was spin-coated (5,000 r.p.m., 12 s) on quartz substrates. During spin-coating, few drops of toluene were added to the film at 3 s after the beginning of spinning. The film was then dried in room temperature for 30 min and annealed at 70 C for 5 min. All the film deposition and annealing was done in N2-filled glove box. The grain size of bulk-film is larger than B1 mm and the thickness is around 240 nm (Supplementary Fig. 3).\n",
      "         treated NCs were grown by a layer-by-layer spin-coating processing method. All the spin-coating steps were set at 1,000 r.p.m. and spin time was fixed for 30 s. To prepare the NC film, NCs in toluene (10 mg ml 1) was spin-coated on glass substrates for two layers. For the EDT treatment of NCs film, the growth of each layer of EDT-treated NCs film consisted of three steps: (         \n",

      "For transistors with SAM treatment, an SAM containing amino terminal groups (NH2SAM) was first formed on n-type silicon substrates covered with a 100 nm thick SiO2 layer. Immersing the NH2SAM into a hydriodic acid solution converted the surface into NH3ISAM. The formation of NH2 and NH3ISAMs was confirmed by X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS) (see Figure S1, Supporting Information). PEASnI4 films were spin-coated on the untreated and NH 3I SAM-treated substrates from a methanol solution of phenethylammonium iodide (PEAI) and SnI2 as shown in Figure 1a. The perovskite films fabricated on untreated and NH 3ISAMtreated substrates had similar thicknesses (about 40 nm) and morphologies (see the atomic force microscopy (AFM) images in Figure 1b).\n",
      "         TC/TG perovskite transistors with NH3ISAM treatment were fabricated using a shorter L of 45 m. These transistors had a h of 8.6  1.5 cm2 V1 s1, Vth of 25  3 V, ION/IOFF of (1.1  1.8)  106, and SS of 1.1  0.2 V dec1. When compared with the transistor performance discussed earlier, the h reduced from 12  1 to 8.6  1.5 cm2 V1 s1 and the Vth increased from 22  2 to 25  3 V as the L was reduced from 95 to 45 m. The reduction of h and increase of Vth at the smaller L suggest that hole injection is still insufcfiient even using the TC Au electrode structure with the MoOx hole-injection layers. In addition to the insufcifient hole injection, the presence of grain boundaries and hole traps in our spin-coated PEASnI4 lfims is another serious issue that strongly limits transistor performance and must be solved. Perovskite transistor performance would be further improved if the aforementioned issues can be solved by optimizing perovskite fabrication conditions and transistor structures. Ultra-high hole mobility would be possible with transistors using perovskite single crystals as semiconductors because perovskite single crystals have no grain boundaries and a very small carrier trap density.[         \n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated a record h of 15 cm2 V1 s1 at room temperature in PEASnI4 transistors. The high h results from several factors including: i) well-developed perovskite crystallites, improved conversion to perovskite, and reduced hole trap density in PEASnI4 films fabricated on an NH3ISAM-treated substrate, ii) improved hole injection by employing a TC/TG structure with MoOx hole-injection layers, and iii) lower hole trap density near the perovskitegate-dielectric interface in a TG structure. NH3ISAM treatment also reduced the hysteresis in the output and transfer characteristics by reducing the amount of residual starting materials and related ions in the perovskite films. The high h along with the negligible hysteresis indicate their strong potential for use as solution-processed, high-performance transistors in future displays, sensors, and storage technologies. notai omuniC C\n",
      "Surface Treatment: First, n-type Si substrates with a thermally grown SiO2 layer having a thickness of 100 nm were cleaned in a mixture of hydrogen peroxide and sulfuric acid and then rinsed with pure water several times. After the substrates were cleaned by ultrasonication in detergent, pure water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol and finally ultravioletozone treatment, the substrates were immersed in a 1  103 m solution of 3-aminopropyltriethoxysilane in toluene heated at 80 C for 12 h in nitrogen for the NH2SAM formation and then rinsed with fresh toluene several times. The NH2SAM-treated substrates were immersed in a 1  103 m aqueous solution of dilute hydriodic acid for 1 min in air to convert the NH2SAM to NH3ISAM. The immersion into a dilute acid solution for a very short period of time was very important to minimize the elimination of NH2SAM from substrates.\n",
      "         Perovskite Film Fabrication: PEAI was synthesized by chemical reaction of phenethylamine with hydriodic acid, followed by recrystallization from toluene blended with ethanol. Synthesized PEAI and purchased SnI2 were dissolved in methanol at a stoichiometric molar ratio of 2:1, and perovskite films were then fabricated on untreated and NH 3I SAM-treated SiO2 layers by spin-coating the solution in nitrogen using experimental conditions similar to a previous report.[         \n",
      "         BG Transistor Fabrication: For the fabrication of BC/BG transistors, 50 nm thick Au source/drain electrodes were vacuum-deposited on top of the untreated and NH3ISAM-treated SiO2 through a contact shadow mask with openings, forming an L of 95 m and a W of 2 mm. The L was measured using an optical microscope (BX51, Olympus). The perovskite layer was spin-coated on the Au source/drain electrodes in the same manner as for the perovskite lfim fabrication to complete the BC/BG transistors. When Au source/drain electrodes were patterned by conventional photolithography and then NH3ISAM treatment was performed, h became smaller by two orders of magnitude, perhaps because of the contamination of the Au surfaces by SAM molecules. For the fabrication of TC/BG transistors without MoOx, 50 nm thick Au source/drain electrodes were directly vacuum-deposited on top of the perovskite layers through the mask. For the fabrication of TC/BG transistors with MoOx, 2 nm thick MoOx hole-injection layers and 50 nm thick Au source/drain electrodes were vacuum-deposited on top of the perovskite layers through the same mask. It was noted that MoOx exists only below the Au, minimizing unexpected carrier doping of the channel region by MoOx. In a vacuum-deposited MoOx layer, x has been reported to be 2.7, which is smaller than the original composition of x = 3.0 because of oxygen vacancy defects formed during vacuum deposition.[         \n",
      "TG Transistor Fabrication: Perovskite layers were fabricated on untreated and NH3ISAM-treated fused silica substrates using the same conditions described earlier. Then, 2 nm thick MoOx layers and 50 nm thick Au source/drain electrodes were vacuum-deposited on the perovskite layers through the same mask. On top of the Au and perovskite layers, a solution (CTL-809M, Asahi Glass) was spin-coated at 7000 rpm for 30 s and dried in vacuum overnight to form a 530 nm thick CYTOP gate dielectric layer. The CTL-809M solution contains CYTOP lfuoropolymer in a fluorine-based solvent (CT-Solv.180, Asahi Glass), so this solvent did not dissolve the underlying perovskite layer (Figure S6, Supporting Information). Finally, a 50 nm thick Al gate electrode layer was vacuum-deposited on the CYTOP layer. The base pressure and rate for the vacuum deposition of Au, MoOx, and Al were on the order of 104 Pa and about 0.1 nm s1, respectively. The L was 95 m and the W was 2 mm for the TG transistors unless otherwise mentioned.\n",
      "The perovskite disc lasers were fabricated using optical lithography with a double layer resist (details are given in the Experimental section), where the bottom layer shielded the perovskite from incompatible chemistry used for the etch mask definition in the top photoactive layer (Figure 1c). Subsequently the pattern was transferred by a single-step process (inductively coupled plasma reactive ion etching, ICP RIE) with Cl2 and CF4 gases, which removed the resist interlayer and then the exposed MAPbI3 film. Scanning electron micrographs show that the polycrystalline structure of the initial material is well preserved after patterning (Figure 2a,b). The line edge roughness along the edge of the patterned perovskite can be attributed to the roughness introduced by the resist etch mask of the contact lithography process. The perovskite sidewall visible in Figure 2b shows a certain degree of under-etching, which increases with the Cl2 content in the etch plasma (not shown). The plasma composition was therefore carefully optimized to find a balance between a low sidewall damage and the rate of formation of volatile PbClx compounds. The samples were further inspected with X-ray diffraction crystallography (XRD) to determine if MAPbI3 degrades during processing (Figure 2c). A small sign of MAPbI3 degradation was detected in the samples after the etching step, recognized by a shoulder in the (110) MAPbI3 peak in the XRD spectrum associated with PbI2. Photoresist stripping did not have an influence on the perovskite. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) analysis revealed a trace of chlorine in the microdiscs (Figure 2d; full EDX spectra are shown in Figure S6).\n",
      "In general, the lasing threshold is reached once the modal gain equals propagation and curvature losses. Because the discs with the smallest radius did not have a higher threshold than the larger discs, it can be assumed that the curvature loss was not dominant. Hence, all lasers would be expected to have similar thresholds because the propagation losses and optical gain depend on morphology, processing, and the physical properties of the perovskite, which should also be similar. The thresholds of lasers with R = 6 m (on 2 different chips) were lower than the thresholds of the other lasers. This can be attributed to changing environmental conditions during the deposition process (e.g., varying solvent vapor content in the glove-box atmosphere) influencing the intrinsic material properties and, therefore, the optical gain. We also observe a slightly red-shifted spectral position of the gain curve compared with the other two samples (Figure 4a), which supports this assumption.\n",
      "Perovskite Deposition. The photonic chips were cleaned from the protective polymer layer through sonication in acetone and isopropanol, followed by 10 min of oxygen plasma cleaning in a RF plasma reactor. The chips were then brought into a nitrogen filled glove box for the subsequent perovskite deposition. The perovskite solution was prepared with 1 M of methylammonium (CH3NH3I, Dyesol), lead iodide (PbI2, 99.9985%, Alfa-Aesar), and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO, anhydrous,  99.9%). These were dissolved in 1 mL of dimethylformamide (DMF, anhydrous, 99.8%) and heated to 60 C for 1 h while stirring. The resulting solution was filtered (0.22 m polytetrafluoroethylene (PTFE) filter) and spincoated on the cleaned silicon substrates at 6000 rpm for 30 s. A total of 300 L of chlorobenzene (anhydrous, 99.8%) was dripped after 6 s from the spin start. The resulting film was exposed to a two-step annealing process (45 C and 5 min plus 100 C and 10 min) to complete the conversion of the precursors into perovskite.\n",
      "Patterning of MAPbI3. First, a 200 nm resist layer was deposited via spin coating. AZ MiR 701 positive tone photoresist was then spin-coated at 3000 rpm and annealed at 95 C for 90 s. Next, the microdisc lasers were defined through a mask by UV light using a contact lithography mask aligner (EVG 420). Afterward the photoresist was baked at 115 C for 90 s and developed for 20 s in MF26 CD developer. The pattern was transferred into the PMMA/MAPbI3 stack in a single reactive ion etch step with Cl2 and CF4 gases. The chlorine forms volatile PbClx compounds,49 while CF4 is used to bind and neutralize excess chlorine to prevent under etching. The photoresist was removed by dipping the samples in a nonpolar solvent at 40 C for 20 min. Immediately after the removal of samples from chlorobenzene, 1 m of PMMA was spin-coated and annealed at 80 C for 10 min.\n",
      "Photoluminescence Mapping. Photoluminescence mapping was performed using a WiTec confocal Raman microscope. The sample was scanned with a 532 nm CW laser at 100 nW power.

      "The metal-halide-based perovskite compounds with the general formula (RNH3)MX3 (R  CnH2n1; X  halogen I, Br, Cl; M  Pb, Cd, Sn and so on) that were used in this study as light harvesters are typical self-assembled materials19. The CH NH3PbI3, prepared 3 by drying 40 wt% of CH3NH3PbI3/g-butyrolactone solution at 100 8C, was characterized by X-ray diffraction (XRD) and thermogravimetric analysis (TGA) (Supplementary Fig. S1). Strong peaks at 14.08, 14.19, 28.24 and 28.508, corresponding to the (002), (110), (004) and (220) planes, confirm the formation of a tetragonal perovskite structure with lattice parameters of a  b  8.88  and c  12.68  (the inset in Supplementary Fig. S1 shows the schematic crystal structure of perovskite). The TGA spectrum shows that the perovskite crystal is thermally stable up to 300 8C, but quickly decomposes above this temperature due to the decomposition of the CH3NH I component, the weight fraction of which is 25.6% in 3 CH3NH3PbI3.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have demonstrated not only a new photovoltaic architecture with efficient photovoltaic performance, but also a useful model system to reveal the correlation between CH3NH3PbI3 and the photovoltaic properties of inorganic organic hybrid systems. Specifically, our study underlines that using three-dimensional composites of TiO2/CH3NH3PbI3 and complementary well-matched polymeric hole conductors is key to realizing good performance. A central finding of our investigation is that PTAA provides the highest efficiency among the polymeric HTMs examined, with higher FF and Voc values than a device based on the molecular spiro-OMeTAD. The cells are highly reproducible and linearly dependent on the illuminated sun intensities, delivering maximum 12.0% PCE under full Sun illumination. These results will lead to more efficient and cost-effective mesoscopic inorganicorganic hybrid heterojunction solar cells in the future. We believe that the present findings offer a new platform for novel approaches to achieve high-efficiency and low-cost solar cells.\n",
      "Solar cell fabrication. A 60-nm-thick layer of dense blocking TiO2 (bl-TiO2) was coated onto a F-doped SnO2 (FTO, Pilkington, TEC8) substrate by spray pyrolysis deposition of 20 mM titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Aldrich) solution at 450 8C to prevent direct contact between the FTO and the holeconducting layer. Mesoporous TiO2 (mp-TiO2) films with thicknesses of 250, 600 and 1,000 nm were screen-printed onto the bl-TiO2/FTO substrate using the TiO2 paste, which was prepared according to a reported method9. The films were calcined at 500 8C for 1 h to remove the organic part. The films were then immersed in 40 mM of TiCl4 aqueous solution at 60 8C for 1 h and heat-treated at 500 8C for 30 min to improve interfacial contact with the nanocrystalline TiO2. CH3NH3I, to be used as a light harvester, was synthesized by reacting 27.86 ml methylamine (40% in methanol, Junsei Chemical Co.) and 30 ml hydroiodic acid (57 wt% in water, Aldrich) in a 250 ml round-bottomed flask at 0 8C for 2 h with stirring.

The product, methyl ammonium iodide (CH3NH3I), was dissolved in ethanol, recrystallized from diethyl ether, and dried at 60 8C in a vacuum oven for 24 h The synthesized CH3NH3I powder was mixed with PbI2 (Aldrich) at a 1:1 mol ratio in g-butyrolactone at 60 8C for 12 h, followed by filtering twice using a PTFF syringe filter (Whatman, 0.45 mm). The concentration of CH3NH3PbI3 was 40 wt%.

      "To fabricate the solid-state solar cells, mesoporous anatase TiO2 films were prepared by spin coating a solution of colloidal anatase particles (20 nm in size) onto a 30-nm-thick compact TiO2 underlayer30. The underlayer was deposited by atomic layer deposition on a pre-patterned transparent-conducting-oxide-coated glass substrate acting as the electric front contact of the solar cell. Deposition of the perovskite light-absorbing layer was carried out by spin coating in a nitrogen glove box to avoid hydrolysis and oxidation of the tin perovskite in contact with air. The triarylamine derivative 2,2,7,7-tetrakis-(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD)31 was then applied as a holetransporting material (HTM) on top of the mesoporous TiO2 and perovskite layer. Lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide and 2,6-lutidine were added in the HTM solution as important dopants to increase the hole mobility31. Figure 2 shows a representative cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of a typical solar cell device. The mesoporous TiO2 film had an average thickness of 350 nm and was infiltrated with the perovskite nanocrystals using the spin-coating procedure. The HTM penetrates into the remaining pore volume of the perovskite/TiO2 layer and forms a 200-nm-thick capping layer on top of the composite structure. A thin gold layer was thermally evaporated under high vacuum onto the HTM layer, forming the back contact electrode of the device.\n",
      "In summary, methylammonium tin halide perovskites (CH3NH3SnI32xBrx) have been used as lead-free light harvesters for solar cell applications for the first time. Featuring an ideal optical bandgap of 1.3 eV, devices with CH3NH3SnI3 perovskite together with an organic spiro-OMeTAD hole-transport layer showed a notable absorption onset up to 950 nm, which is significantly redshifted compared with its benchmark CH3NH3PbI3 counterpart (1.55 eV). The bandgap engineering of CH3NH3SnI32xBrx perovskites can be controllably tuned to cover much of the visible spectrum, thus enabling the realization of lead-free, colourful solar cells and leading to a promising initial PCE of 5.73% under simulated full sunlight. Further efficiency enhancements would be expected by the fundamental understanding of the internal electron dynamics and corresponding interfacial engineering. The reported CH3NH3SnI32xBrx perovskites are believed to represent a significant step towards the realization of low-cost, high-efficiency, environmentally benign, next-generation solid-state solar cells.\n",
      "Materials. Unless stated otherwise, all materials were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich and used as received. Spiro-OMeTAD was purchased from Merck KGaA. CH3NH3I, CH3NH3Br and SnI2 were synthesized and purified according to a reported procedure23. CH3NH3SnI32xBrx compounds were prepared by mixing stoichiometric amounts of CH3NH3X and SnX2 (X  Br, I), finely homogenized in a mortar in a nitrogen glove box. The resulting solids were sealed in quartz ampules under 1  1024 mbar vacuum and heated to 200 8C to complete the reaction23. Material characterization. Optical diffuse-reflectance measurements were performed at room temperature using a Shimadzu UV-3101 PC double-beam, double-monochromator spectrophotometer operating from 200 nm to 2,500 nm. BaSO4 was used as a non-absorbing reflectance reference. Photoluminescence spectra were measured with an OmniPV photoluminescence system, equipped with a diode-pumped frequency-doubled Nd:YAG laser (500 mW power output, class 4) emitting at 532 nm coupled with a bundle of eight 400-mm-core optical fibres as an excitation source. Resistivity measurements were made for arbitrary current directions in the ab plane using a standard point contact geometry. A homemade resistivity apparatus was used that was equipped with a Keithley 2182A nanovoltometer, Keithley 617 electrometer, Keithley 6220 Precision d.c. source and a high-temperature vacuum chamber controlled by a K-20 MMR system. Seebeck measurements were performed on the same homemade apparatus using Cr/Cr:Ni thermocouples as electric leads, which were attached to the sample surface by means of colloidal graphite isopropanol suspension. The temperature gradient along the crystal was generated by a resistor on the hot side of the crystal. The data were corrected for the thermocouple contribution using a copper wire. SEM and energydispersive spectroscopy (EDS) measurements were performed with a Hitachi SU8030 scanning electron microscope equipped with an Oxford X-max 80 SDD EDS detector. Data were acquired with an accelerating voltage of 15 kV. Device fabrication. A fluorine-doped tin oxide-coated glass substrate (Tec15, Hartford Glass) was patterned by etching with Zn metal powder and 2 M HCl diluted in deionized water. The substrates were then cleaned by ultrasonication with detergent, rinsed with deionized water, acetone and ethanol, and dried with clean dry air. A 30-nm-thick TiO2 compact layer was deposited on the substrates by an atomic layer deposition system (Savannah S300, Cambridge Nanotech) using titanium isopropoxide (TTIP) and water as precursors. The mesoporous TiO2 layer composed of 20-nm-sized particles was deposited by spin coating at 4,500 r.p.m. for 30 s using a hydrothermal-synthesized TiO2 paste diluted in ethanol (1:4, weight ratio). After drying at 125 8C, the TiO2 films were gradually heated to 500 8C, baked at this temperature for 15 min, and then cooled to room temperature (25 8C). After cooling to room temperature, the substrates were treated in a 0.02 M aqueous solution of TiCl4 for 30 min at 70 8C, rinsed with deionized water, and dried at 500 8C for 20 min. Before use, the films were again dried at 500 8C for 30 min.\n",
      "CH3NH3SnI32xBrx was dissolved in N,N-dimethylformamide at a weight concentration of 30% while stirring at 70 8C. The solution was kept at 70 8C during the whole procedure. The mesoporous TiO2 films were then infiltrated with CH3NH3SnI32xBrx by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 45 s and dried at 125 8C for 30 min to remove the solvent. The HTM was then deposited by spin coating at 4,000 r.p.m. for 30 s. The spin-coating formulation was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg spiro-OMeTAD, 30 ml 2,6-lutidine, 17.5 ml of a stock solution of 520 mg ml21 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 ml chlorobenzene. Finally, 100 nm of gold was thermally evaporated on top of the device to form the back contact. The devices were sealed in nitrogen using a 30-mmthick hot-melting polymer and a microscope coverslip to prevent oxidation. Device characterization. JV characteristics were measured under AM 1.5G light (100 mW cm22) using the xenon arc lamp of a Spectra-Nova Class A solar simulator. Light intensity was calibrated using an NREL-certified monocrystalline Si diode coupled to a KG3 filter to bring the spectral mismatch to unity. A Keithley 2400 source meter was used for electrical characterization. The active area of all devices was 10 mm2, and an 8 mm2 aperture mask was placed on top of the cells during all measurements. IPCEs were characterized using an Oriel model QE-PV-SI instrument equipped with a NIST-certified Si diode. Monochromatic light was generated from an Oriel 300 W lamp.\n",
      "We show in Figure 5A the JV curve for the best device fabricated from PbAc21.5H2O precursor solution with 5 min anneal at 100 C, measured under simulated AM 1.5G (100 mW cm1) solar irradiation in air, exhibiting outstanding performance with Jsc = 23.32 mA cm2, Voc = 0.87 V, FF = 0.75, and PCE = 15.2% when scanned forward from negative bias, and Jsc = 22.28 mA cm2, Voc = 0.88 V, FF = 0.74, and PCE = 14.5% when scanned backward from large positive bias. The hysteresis between forward and backward JV scan is almost negligible compared with the hysteresis from TiO2 based device. The efficiency histogram in Figure 5B shows >17% of the device the PCE higher than 14%, and >78% of the device the PCE higher than 11%. To rule out the possible hydration water induced influence of PEDOT:PSS layer, a similar hydration water optimization has been done on the inorganic p-type NiO based perovskite solar cell. The results (shown in Figures 6 and 7) show that the solar cell made from precursor B (3MAI:1PbAc21.5H2O) exhibit the best performance, which is in consistence with PEDOT based devices.\n",
      "In summary, we have systematically studied the role of hydration water in perovskite precursors during perovskite crystallization. Our results suggest that a portion of hydration water in perovskite precursors will assist the formation of MAPbI3 monohydrate intermediate, which will be dehydrated in the air and turn to a high quality pristine MAPbI3 film in the end. The redundant hydration water will be released into the precursor solution and have an adverse impact on the formation of perovskite film, similar as directly mixing water into precursor solution. Therefore reducing the redundant hydration water by precisely controlling the content of hydration water in precursors is of great importance to produce highly efficient perovskite solar cells. As the introduction of content controlled hydration water can be accomplished during the precursor solution preparation, the extreme simplicity of this method make it of great value for the future mass production.\n",
      "Perovskite Precursor Solution Preparation: Lead acetate trihydrate (PbAc23H2O) and Lead chloride (PbCl2) were both purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. MAI was purchased from Materwin. To generate the 3MAI:1PbAc2xH2O precursor solution, the PbAc23H2O was first heated to 100 C in the glovebox to release the hydration water. The PbAc2xH2O was then obtained by mixing dehydrate PbAc2 with PbAc23H2O at a molar ratio of (3x):x. Finally MAI and PbAc2xH2O were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethyformamide at a 3:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 40 wt%. To generate the precursor solution D, MAI and PbCl2 were dissolved in anhydrous N,N-dimethyformamide at a 3:1 molar ratio with the concentration of 40 wt%. To generate the precursor solutions E and F, the precursor solution D was mixed with precursor solution C and A, respectively, with 1:1 molar ratio of PbCl2 and PbAc2.\n",
      "Device Fabrication: Devices were fabricated on ITO-coated glass with 10  1 sheet resistance (purchased from Shenzhen Nanbo Co. Ltd., China). Substrates were then cleaned sequentially in detergent, deionized water, and UV-ozone. The PEDOT:PSS (CLEVIOS P VP Al 4083) was spin coated on clean ITO substrate at a speed of 4000 rpm. The films were then annealed at 130 C for 30 min. Perovskite films were spin coated from the prepared precursor solutions at a speed of 2000 rpm, and annealed on the hotplate at 100 C for different optimized anneal time. The thickness of perovskite was 400 nm measured by profilometer (Dektak 150), and 360 nm by Filmetrics F20-UV. The PCBM (dissolved in CB, 20 mg mL1) was spin-coated on top of the perovskite layer at 1800 rpm for 30 s. The device was finished by thermal evaporation of C60 (20 nm), BCP (8 nm), and Ag (100 nm).\n",
      "         The perovskite NCs with mixed-cations, Cs/FA, were prepared using a precursor of FABr and PbBr2, by adding different amounts of CsBr for Cs cation doping. Specifically, the mixture of precursors was added dropwise into the toluene solution for NC formation, followed by centrifugation of the final product. The as-obtained perovskite NCs were dispersed in tetra hydro furan with a concentration of 20 mg mL1. The as-obtained perovskite crystallizes with a cubic shape, with an average size of 910 nm, as confirmed by the size distribution of different samples as a function of Cs content, x (Figure S1, Supporting Information). The crystal follows the typical perovskite adopted by the ABX3 compound (Figure 1). To further investigate the impact of Cs doping on the lattice fringe of FA(1x)CsxPbBr3, high resolution transmission electron microscopy (TEM) is measured and shown in Figure 1c. The perovskite sheet is crystalline, as reported in previous work.[         \n",
      "We have successfully prepared perovskite, FA(1x)CsxPbBr3, NCs based on mixed cations (caesium and formamidinium). The roles of the Cs doping in the perovskite in the crystal formation, morphology, and performance of LEDs, were systematically investigated. We found that Cs cations doped in FA affects the perovskite crystal lattice, which in turn affects the otina omuniC C www.advancedsciencenews.com absorption and PL spectra of perovskite by Vegards law. As Cs content is increased, the perovskite NCs witnessed a blue-shift in their bandgap and emission peak. This work used mixedcations perovskite, FA(1x)CsxPbBr3, NCs as light emitting materials for LEDs. The demonstrated perovskite LEDs, with an optimized composition of FA0.8Cs0.2PbBr3, exhibit a highest reported luminance 55005 cd m2, and a promising efficiency of 10.09 cd A1. An excess of Cs doping in FA(1x)CsxPbBr3 (x > 0.2) can form a rough surface in the perovskite film that introduces shorting pathways in the LED devices. The use of mixed cations provides additional versatility in fine-tuning the optical bandgap and emission wavelength. This work opens the prospect for other cations, like MA, to be explored as mixedcations for perovskites. Therefore, cation mixtures are a novel compositional strategy on the road to industrialization of perovskite LEDs.\n",
      "         Cell Preparation and Testing: FTO glass substrates (TEC7, XOP) were etched using a Ronfi Nd:YVO4 laser (532 nm, speed of 150 mm s 1), cleaned with Hellmanex solution in deionized water, washed with 1900885 (8 of 10) deionized water, and rinsed in acetone and isopropanol, before being O2 plasma treated. A 50 nm thick compact TiO2 layer was deposited via spray pyrolysis at 300 C from a solution of 10% titanium di-isopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (Sigma) in isopropanol. The mesoporous triple stack was obtained via screen printing of commercial pastes: rfist, the TiO 2 layer (30 NRD Dyesol, diluted 1:1 by weight with terpineol), followed by sintering at 550 C for 30 min; then the ZrO2 layer (ZT/SP Solaronix), sintered at 400 C for 30 min; nfially, the carbon layer (Gwent Electronic Materials), sintered at 400 C for 30 min, as previously reported.[         \n",
      "Perovskite solar cells can be implemented in both mesoscopic (or planar, regular) and planar heterojunction (inverted) architectures. Perovskite films used in solar cells have been fabricated by a one-step5,22 or two-step8,14 solution process as well as by the co-evaporation7 method. Nevertheless, no perovskitePCBM bulk heterojunction (BHJ) active films applied in an inverted device have been reported up until now. This is probably because the three components: PbI2, MAI and PCBM are not all soluble in a single solvent and co-evaporating these three components to form a BHJ film is a great challenge. Recently, we have developed a two-step spin-coating method to synthesize high quality perovskite films at low temperature under ambient atmophere14,15. In that twostep spin-coating method, a PbI2 film was first spin-coated on a PEDOT:PSS surface and then a MAI/IPA solution was added via spin coating to form a perovskite film. PbI2 and PCBM are both soluble in DMF although the solubility of these two compounds in DMF is limited. A PbI2PCBM hybrid film can be made in the first step from a PbI2PCBM/DMF precursor solution and the BHJ CH3NH3PbI3-PCBM film was formed by adding an MAI/ IPA solution. The quality of the perovskite absorber (the defects, grain sizes and flatness of the film) was the major factor for determining the PV performance of the cell13. Therefore, instead of using an additive or post-treatment to improve the film quality, in this Article we used PCBM acceptor molecules to fill the vacancies and grain boundaries of the perovskite film to achieve a cell with both high power conversion efficiency (PCE) and high fill factor. The result represents an attractive approach to improving the quality of perovskite films. It also demonstrates that the BHJ concept can be used to create inverted perovskite solar cells with high efficiency.\n",
      "The fabrication steps and architecture of the inverted BHJ perovskite solar cell are displayed in Fig. 1. The device architecture shown in Fig. 1(i) resembles a simple BHJ structure generally used in polymer solar cells (PSCs). Perovskite, instead of a p-type polymer, is used as a light absorber as well as an electron donor and PCBM as an electron acceptor. However, the solubility of PCBM in DMF is limited: when the concentration of PCBM in PbI2PCBM/DMF solution is 1.0 wt%, some insoluble PCBM molecules were observed (see Supplementary Fig. 1). Therefore the highest concentrations of PbI2 and PCBM used in this study are 0.75 M and 1.0 wt%, respectively. The PV performance of the inverted cells based on perovskite films fabricated with various amounts of PCBM in PbI2/DMF precursor solutions, without an extra acceptor layer, is presented in Supplementary Table 1 and the corresponding IV curves are shown in Supplementary Fig. 2. The PCE of the cell using pure perovskite as the absorber layer and electron transporter is very low (<0.1%). However, when a small amount (0.01 wt%) of PCBM was added to the PbI2/DMF solution, the PCE of the corresponding inverted cell increases significantly to 9.8%. When the concentration of PCBM in PbI2/DMF solution was increased to 0.1 wt%, the efficiency of the resulting device further increased to more than 12%. Further increasing the PCBM concentration to 1 wt% resulted in the PCE of the corresponding cell decreasing to 5.9%, as PCBM does not totally dissolve in DMF (see Supplementary Fig. 1). The quality of the PbI2PCBM and the resulting perovskite films are thus very poor.\n",
      "In conclusion, we employed a two-step spin-coating method14 to prepare PbI2PCBM hybrid films and consequently BHJ CH3NH3PbI3PCBM inverted perovskite solar cells. Adding a small amount of PCBM into the PbI2 precursor solution can tune the morphology of the resulting PbI2PCBM hybrid film. By carefully controlling the amount of PCBM in the PbI2 precursor solution, the volume and concentration of the MAI/IPA solution, high-quality BHJ perovskitePCBM films can be prepared. An inverted cell with a simple architecture of ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJ perovskite0.1 wt% PCBM/Ca/Al and a PCE of 12.1% is reported. When an extra layer of PCBM is added on top of the BHJ perovskite0.1 wt% PCBM film, the PCE of the resulting cell increases to 16.0% with a remarkably high fill factor of 0.82 and no photocurrent hysteresis. The excellent PV response of the cell based on the BHJ perovskitePCBM/PCBM active layer is mainly due to the high conductivity, good balance in electron and hole mobility, and long charge diffusion length of the BHJ perovskitePCBM film. This work demonstrates for the first time that the BHJ concept used in polymer solar cells can also be applied successfully to inverted perovskite solar cells to improve the fill factor. Furthermore, the results provide a step towards the widespread use of the two-step solution process and the fabrication of highefficiency, large-area and low-cost perovskite solar cells for commercial applications.\n",
      "Solar cell fabrication and measurement of PV parameters. The processes for cleaning the patterned ITO substrates and depositing PEDOT:PSS hole transporting layer are the same as reported previously14. For depositing BHJ perovskitePCBM films, first a layer of a PbI2PCBM hybrid film was spin-coated on top of a PEDOT: PSS-coated ITO substrate from 0.75 M PbI2/DMF solutions containing various amounts of PCBM. The PCBMPbI2/DMF precursor solution is sonicated for 1 h then heated at 100 C for 12 h to make sure that both PbI2 and PCBM were totally dissolved. Before the PbI2PCBM film is totally dry, CH3NH3I was spin-coated on top of the hybrid film from a 30 L isopropanol (IPA) solution with various concentrations at spin rates of 2000 rpm for 30 s to form the perovskite structure. Specifically, the highest-efficiency device was fabricated with the concentration of CH3NH3I/IPA at approximately 50 mg ml1. All of the fabrication procedures were carried out in an ambient atmosphere. The ITO/PEDOT:PSS/BHJperovskitePCBM was transferred to a vacuum chamber for coating with Ca (20 nm) and then Al (100 nm) as electrodes. To increase the efficiency of the device, before depositing the metal electrodes a layer of PCBM was spin-coated on top of the BHJ perovskitePCBM film at 1,000 rpm for 30 s from 4 wt% PCBM in chlorobenzene. The sun simulator and other instruments used, the definition of the cell area (approximately 0.5  0.2 cm) with a defined mask, the IV (scan rates are 0.02  0.5 V s1 and 140 data points were taken; a scan rate of 0.02 V s1 was used to perform the forward and reverse scans) and IPCE curves measurements, the determination of the PV parameters and the calibration of all measuring systems are all the same as reported previously15. The stability of the cell in darkness was tested by putting the cell in a non-transparent container and storing it in a glove box for 30 days before measuring the efficiency again.

      "For the fabrication of solar cells, the iodide-based amine complex precursors were blended stoichiometrically or at a designed ratio and then deposited on a TiO2/fluorine-doped tin oxide (FTO) substrate via our pressure processing system. Thin perovskite films with an area of about 60 cm2 were rapidly formed with no need for post-treatment when the film released CH3NH2 gas (which could be recycled for production of new amine complex precursors).

The results show a good reproducibility from cell to cell, mainly benefitting from the uniformity of the perovskite films over large areas. On mesoporous TiO2 based modules, efficiencies of 15.8% and 13.9% were achieved in the laboratory with an illuminated aperture area of 17.6 cm2 and 36.1 cm2, respectively. The IV curves of a module (36.1 cm2) measured in forward and backward directions are given in Fig. 3d and exhibited a hysteresis with PCEs of 13.9% and 15.4%, respectively.

Extended Data Fig. 9 shows that the PCE of a sealed perovskite module kept 90% of its initial value after continuous working at the maximum-power point under light for 500 h, which indicates a good stability of the present high-efficiency perovskite modules.\n",

      "Although a number of computational screening studies have been conducted, the present work is novel for three reasons. First, the screening analysis employed here is more complete as it i) incorporates stability assessment by using convex hull analysis under a realistic solar cell operating environment, which is more accurate for determining stability than approaches employed in previous studies, and ii) incorporates PV ef-fi ciency calculations to place a more stringent screening criterion beyond simply analyzing bandgaps. Second, we have considered a more diverse composition space than previous studies, consisting of both organic molecules and inorganic elements, and also a variety of alloying schemes for the perovskite A-, B-, and X-sites. For example, we have considered numerous compositions of the A-, B-, and X-sites, including combined A-site/B-site and B-site/X-site alloying and mixtures of inorganic and organic 1804354 (2 of 16) species on the A-site.

Our optimal device achieved a PCE of 3.12%, with a Jsc of 16.07 mA cm2, a Voc of 0.31 V, and a FF of 62.6% (Figure 4c). The Jsc of this flexible device is lower than that of the glassITO based device. As shown in Figure 4d, the IPCE spectrum exhibits a lower value than that of the glassITO based device over the whole spectral range. Figure S14 (Supporting Information) shows the bending test with a bending radius of 4 mm for the flexible solar cells. The PCE gradually decreased to 2.89% even after 100 bending tests. After 500 tests, however, the PCE diminished to 2.02%. Finally, the device showed a poor PCE of 0.65% after 1000 times. The dramatically reduced PCE after 500 times is mainly attributed to crack formation on the brittle ITO. The stability of this flexible device without encapsulation was monitored over time (Figure S15, Supporting Information). The PCE decreased to 1.06% in 3 d in the glovebox and quickly reduced to 0.03% in ambient conditions. To our knowledge, this is the first report of efficient flexible Pb-free perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "In conclusion, functional FASnI3-based PHJ solar cells have been achieved by a water-based eco-friendly multichannel interdiffusion method, which significantly promotes good film coverage and crystallinity. The film formation can be readily controlled by individually manipulating FAI/PEDOT:PSS and SnI2 layers. A clear variation morphology and crystallinity between the FAI layer and the resulting FASnI3 film show that a denser layer of tiny FAI spheres is formed, which is driven by the introduction of PEDOT:PSS. Under the stable C60 protection layer, the most efficient PHJ device delivers a PCE up to 3.98% at PEDOT:PSS concentration of 20%. We also report a breakthrough in Pb-free eflxible solar cells with a promising PCE of 3.12%, which is a rfist step in diversifying the device types available with these remarkable materials. Continued development 1606964 (5 of 7) PCE dramatically decreased to 0.24% after only 1 d. Overall, the stability of the FASnI3-based devices is still a bottleneck, and further approaches should be developed to stabilize the FASnI3 solar cells.\n",
      "         Perovskite Film Fabrication: PEDOT:PSS (Clevios Al4083) and SnI2 (99.999%) were purchased from Haraeus and Alfa Aesar, respectively. BCP (99%) was obtained from Nichem, Taiwan. FAI was synthesized as reported previously.[         \n",
      "Device Fabrication: To avoid possible surface oxidation of the SnI2 iflm, C 60 (30 nm) was evaporated at a rate of 1.0  s1 sequentially following the SnI2 film before the substrate was transferred into the glovebox. Then, FAI-PP/SnI2/C60 triple-stack film was annealed with the same condition of FASnI3 film in the glovebox. Afterward, all substrates were directly returned into the vacuum chamber (under 105 mbar). The device was completed by continuously evaporating BCP (8 nm), and Ag (120 nm) at a rate of 1.0  s1. The thicknesses of vacuum-deposited C60, BCP, and Ag were monitored using quartz crystal monitors (the tooling factors are 0.35, 0.43, and 1.00 for C60, BCP, and Ag, respectively). After fabrication, all the devices were kept unencapsulated for further measurements using a shadow mask of 9.0 mm2.\n",
      "CsPbBr3 perovskite device preparation. CsPbBr3 is a fully inorganic halide perovskite material, inherently unstable in water like most other organicinorganic halide perovskites. Supplementary Fig. 1a, b shows the X-ray diffraction (XRD) patterns and UV-vis absorption of a CsPbBr3 film before and after it was dipped in water for 1 s. The initial XRD spectrum was in good agreement with the orthorombic perovskite structure43, however, after immersion in water, its distinct (100), (110) and (200) diffraction peaks rapidly disappeared and peaks characteristic of the precursor materials PbBr2 and CsBr appeared. While pristine CsPbBr3 has a bandgap of 2.35 eV with an absorption onset corresponding to 530 nm giving rise to its yellow colour, after immersion in water only a semitransparent white material remains (PbBr2). Therefore, in order to use CsPbBr3 in aqueous PEC cells for solar water splitting, effective protection strategies need to be developed as for any other halide perovskite.\n",
      "We prepared our perovskite photoanodes based on the architecture of a standard carbon perovskite solar cell. Generally, perovskite solar cells are made using an absorber material sandwiched between an electron transport layer (ETL) and a hole transport layer (HTL). In these cells, a compact layer of TiO2 deposited by spray pyrolysis and a doctor-bladed mesoporous carbon layer (m-carbon or m-c) were used as the ETL and HTL, respectively, as shown in Fig. 1a (Supplementary Fig. 2 shows a schematic energy band diagram). CsPbBr3 solar cells with similar carbon-based architectures have already shown good stability over 3 months in humid air, thanks to the hydrophobic nature of the m-carbon HTL44. Indeed, the water contact angle (WCA) of the mesoporous carbon layer used here exceeded 90 (Supplementary Fig. 3). Figure 1b shows a cross-sectional scanning electron microscopy (SEM) image of the as-prepared CsPbBr3 structure with a 20-m-thick m-carbon layer acting as conducting contact. Energy dispersive X-ray (EDX) mapping images of the CsPbBr3 solar cell are shown in Supplementary Fig. 4, confirming the formation of a TiO2|CsPbBr3|m-c stack. Figure 1c shows the FTO|TiO2|CsPbBr3 interfaces with thin layers of TiO2 and CsPbBr3 of about 50 and 350 nm, respectively.\n",
      "Photoanode fabrication. FTO glass TEC 7 (Sigma-Aldrich) was etched with zinc powder and HCl (2 M). It was then cleaned in 2 vol% Hellmanex solution in water, followed by de-ionised (DI) water, acetone (VWR), 2-propanol (IPA, VWR) and ethanol (EtOH,VWR) before being treated with UV-Ozone cleaning (in ProCleaner PLUS for 20 min). A compact TiO2 layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis, using a hand-held atomiser to spray 0.2 M solution of titanium diisopropoxide bis (acetylacetonate) (75 wt%, Sigma-Aldrich) in EtOH onto the substrates held at 500 C. Substrates were then sintered at this temperature for 10 min. PbBr2 solution (1 M in DMF) was spin coated on top of the substrates held at 70 C at 2500 rpm for 30 s and each cell was further sintered at 70 C for 30 min. The cell was then immersed in the CsBr solution (17 mg ml1 in methanol) kept at 50 C in a vertical staining jar for 30 min before being annealed at 150 C for 30 min. A carbon paste (black carbon + graphite, Gwent Electronic Materials) was doctor bladed as top contact on top of the CsPbBr3 film. Devices were further post-annealed at 380 C for 30 min in air for the mesoporous carbon (m-c) layer formation. A graphite thermal sheet (RS, Panasonic, 1600 Wm1 K1, 180  115 mm, 0.025 mm, selfadhesive on one side) was stuck by hand onto the mesoporous carbon top layer.

      "Ir catalyst preparation. The iridium precursor [Cp*Ir(pyalc)Cl] was synthesised according to previous literature reports59. Forty-eight milligrams of the precursor (0.1 mmol) was added to 20 ml of DI water in an open beaker and a clear orange solution was stirred vigorously for 5 min. Under constant stirring, 540 mg (2.5 mmol) of NaIO4 were added to the beaker and the dark blue solution was allowed to stir overnight at room temperature. A piece of GS was floated on the unstirred, blue Ir-WOC solution overnight to bind the catalyst. It was then rinsed with DI water and left to dry at room temperature.\n",
      "Inorganic metal halide perovskite nanocrystals (NCs) have been employed universally in light-emitting applications during the past two years. Here, blue-emission (470 nm) Cs-based perovskite NCs are derived by directly mixing synthesized bromide and chloride nanocrystals with a weight ratio of 2:1. High-brightness blue perovskite light-emitting diodes (PeLEDs) are obtained by controlling the grain size of the perovskite films. Moreover, a white PeLED is demonstrated for the first time by blending orange polymer materials with the blue perovskite nanocrystals as the active layer. Exciton transfer from the blue nanocrystals to the orange polymers via Frster or Dexter energy transfer is analyzed through time resolved photoluminescence. By tuning the ratio between the perovskite nanocrystals and polymers, pure white light is achieved with the a CIE coordinate at (0.33,0.34).\n",
      "high photoluminescence (PL) quantum yield (QY) reaching 90% in solution.[14] The outstanding properties of CsPbX3 NCs make them especially attractive for electroluminescence (EL) applications, with more and more groups[1925] investigating LEDs using CsPbX3 NCs, since the ifrst work was reported by Song et al. [19]\n",
      "However, blue PeLEDs are still under investigation and will play an important role in display applications. Li et al. reported Cs-based blue PeLEDs with an emission peak at 480 nm and a brightness at 8.7 cd m2.[22] Song et al. have also reported bright blue CsPbX3 PeLEDs with maximum luminance of 742 cd m2 centered at 455 nm. Another brighter Csbased blue PeLED was reported with maximum brightness of 35 cd m2 and an emission peak at 490 nm.[24] In this work, we demonstrate a high brightness of blue all-inorganic PeLEDs with narrow FWHM of the PL and EL spectra by controlling the dispersity of CsPbBrxCl3x nanocrystals in the deposition solution to determine the grain size of perovskite films. Different mixed-phase CsPbBrxCl3x nanocrystals can be simply derived through blending the pure CsPbBr3 and CsPbCl3 nanocrystals dispersed in appropriate solvents according to the ligands around the nanocrystals. The mixed phases interestingly deliver narrow emission peak as reported by several groups.[2629] Although pure CsPbCl3 exhibits only 1% on PLQY, pure CsPbBr3 can reach as high as 78% indicating that the tunable bandgap raises possibilities of a compromise between emission wavelength and luminescence efficiency. Since the emission wavelength can be modulated from pure CsPbBr3, 510 nm, to pure CsPbCl3, 390 nm, a blue emission of CsPbBrxCl3x nanoparticles was successfully obtained (470 nm) here. To reasonably choose the carrier types in the design of the device structure, ultraviolet photoelectron spectroscopy (UPS) was employed to characterize the conduction-band minimum (CBM) and the valence-band maximum (VBM) of the mixed phase CsPbBrxCl3x. An important issue is that the solvents used to deposit the perovskite films not only determine the dispersity of the CsPbBrxCl3x nanocrystals in solution but also determine the grain sizes. By applying the appropriate solvent, the grain sizes of perovskite crystals can be controlled to be very tiny. Hence, we attribute the high-brightness blue PeLEDs to a benign quantum-confinement effect, in accordance with the small grain sizes of CsPbBrxCl3x films. With the bright blue EL, we can build the first white PeLEDs by blending with organic orange-light-emissive materials.\n",
      "Nanocrystals Synthesis: CsPbBrxCl3x was synthesized with reference to a previously reported method.[14] Cs2CO3 (0.407 g, Aldrich, 99.995%), octadecene (20 mL, ODE, SigmaAldrich, 90%), and oleic acid (1.25 mL, OA, SigmaAldrich, 90%) were loaded into a 50 mL three-neck flask, and subsequently dried for 2 h at 150 C in Ar. Cs-oleate with yellow color was then obtained. ODE (100 mL), oleylamine (12.5 mL, OLA, Sigma Aldrich, 70%), 12.5 mL OA and PbX2 (3.76 mmol) such as PbBr2 (1.38 g, SigmaAldrich, 99.999%), and PbCl2 (1.04 g, SigmaAldrich, 99.999%) were loaded into a 500 mL three-neck flask and dried under vacuum for 2 h at 120 C. After that, the temperature was raised to 170 C for CsPbBr3 and 200 C for CsPbCl3, and then 12 mL of 0.125 m Cs-oleate solution were injected within 5 s. Allowing for 1 min reaction, the mixture was immediately cooled by way of an ice-water bath. For CsPbCl3, 25 mL of trioctylphosphine were further added into the reaction system. After the ice-water cooling, nanocrystals were precipitated out by adding tert-butanol (Fisher Chemical, Certified) as an antisolvent, followed by centrifugation at 8000 rpm for 8 min. After discarding the supernatant, the as-obtained particles were redispersed in hexane (EMD, 95%) and were filtered through 0.2 m syringes. Tert-BuOH was used for the second time to precipitate the nanocrystals, followed by centrifugation. The obtained nanocrystals were dispersed in toluene or toluene/hexane joint solvent for application later.\n",
      "Device Fabrication and Characterization: PeLEDs were fabricated on ITO-coated glass substrates, which served as the anode. The ITO substrates were ultrasonically cleaned in detergent, deionized water, acetone, and isopropyl alcohol. The NiOx precursor was spin www.advmat.de coated on the ITO and annealed at 300 C for 60 min in ambient air. The CsPbBrxCl3x nanocrystals in solvent A, solvent B, and solvent C (5 mg mL1) were spin coated on the NiOx layers and annealed at 90 C for 3 min in ambient air. The white-emission layers were deposited from the solution, with different weight-ratio compositions between CsPbBrxCl3x and MEH:PPV. The perovskite-coated samples were then transferred into a vacuum chamber for the thermal vapor deposition of TPBi, LiF, and Al at rates of 0.1, 0.1, and 0.2 nm s1, respectively. The device area was 0.1 cm2, defined by the overlapping section between the pattern of ITO and the electrode from the shadow mask. The JLV characteristics of PeLEDs were measured using two Keithley 2400 source units. The intensity of the EL was recorded by a silicon photodiode (Hamamatsu S1133-14, Japan) as calibrated by a PR650 spectrophotometer (Photo Research, USA).\n",
      "         Perovskite solar cells were then fabricated by the consecutively depositing perovskite layer, hole-transport layer, and gold electrode on the FTO loaded -Fe2O3 electron extraction layers. For comparison, planar and mesoporous -Fe2O3 perovskite solar cells were also fabricated. Figure 1d illustrates the energy level diagram of the FTO/-Fe2O3/perovskite structure. Upon light irradiation, the photogenerated electrons on the CH3NH3PbI3 conduction band inject into -Fe2O3. The cross-sectional SEM images of the as-fabricated devices (planar -Fe2O3, -Fe2O3 nanoislands, and mesoporous -Fe2O3) are shown in Figure 2a. The effectiveness of these -Fe2O3 films in extracting electron from perovskite was first evaluated by performing the charge carrier dynamics (charge transfer or charge injection behavior) measurements. The steady state photoluminescence (PL) spectra of the perovskite layer spin coated on different -Fe2O3 films show a strong emission peak at around 780 nm (Figure S9, Supporting Information). The nanoislands and mesoporous -Fe2O3 loaded perovskite films showed obviously weaker emission peaks and the PL intensities were reduced by a magnitude of three-fold compared with that of planar film. This result means that the photogenerated electrons produced in perovskite can be extracted to -Fe2O3 nanoislands more quickly than planar one before bulk recombination.[         \n",
      "Preparation of the Iron(III) Oxide Electron Extraction Layers: The FTOcoated glass substrates were ultrasonically washed with detergent, deionized water, ethanol, acetone, and isopropanol for 15 min successively. The cleaned FTO glass was treated with an ultraviolet/ O3 cleaner for at least 15 min. Polysorbate-80 (Tween 80) polymer with an average molecular weight of 79 000 g mol1 and a density of 1.06 g cm3 was purchased from Sigma-Aldrich. In a water-free container, 110 mg Fe(NO3)39H2O dissolved in 2 mL ethanol solution, followed by the addition of 60 mg polysorbate-80. The mixed solution was stirred at 600 rpm for 30 min. Then 0.6 mL 2-methoxyethanol was added to the above ethanol solution and the solution was stirred at 600 rpm for another 30 min. The precursor was spin-coated on cleaned FTO substrates at 6000 rpm for 40 s (acceleration speed 1000 rpm s1). Optimal relative humidity was 5070%. The films were left in air for 30 min and then were heated to 250 C using 4 h ramp and aged at this temperature for 12 h. Thereafter, the samples were heated to 500 C in an oxygen atmosphere using 60 min ramp and were annealed at 500 C for 30 min.\n",
      "For the preparation of the compact and planar iron(III) oxide film, 0.05 m Fe(NO3)39H2O dissolved in ethanol was spun on the cleaned FTO glass at 6000 rpm for 40 s, followed by sintering at 500 C for 30 min in air. The compact/mesoporous -Fe2O3 film was prepared by spin coating the -Fe2O3 nanoisland precursor (the dosage of polysorbate-80 is 160 mg) onto the planar -Fe2O3 film at 4000 rpm for 40 s. The films were heated to 500 C in an oxygen atmosphere using 5 h ramp and are annealed at 500 C for 30 min.\n",
      "Device Fabrication: The perovskite precursor solution was prepared by dissolving PbI2 and CH3NH3I into the solvent of dimethyl sulfoxide and N,N-dimethylformamide (3:7 volume ratio), followed by stirring at 1702090 (7 of 9) room temperature for 4 h to produce a clear solution. Subsequently, in an N2-purged glove box (<1.0 ppm O2 and H2O), the perovskite precursor solution was coated onto the iron(III) oxides coated FTO substrate by two consecutive spin-coating steps of 1000 and 3500 rpm for 15 and 40 s, respectively. 500 L toluene was rapidly dropped on the substrates to induce fast crystallization after 30 s spin-coating. To remove excess reagents or solvent, the preliminary perovskite film was immediately placed on a hot plate at 100 C for 25 min. The thickness of the perovskite layer was about 520 nm. After the films were cooled down to room temperature, the hole-transporting material (HTM) was subsequently spin cast on perovskite layer by spin coating a mixture solution (4000 rpm for 40 s), which was prepared by adding 72.3 mg 2,2,7,-7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobifluorene (spiro-OMeTAD), 28.8 L 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5 L stock solution consisting of 520 mg mL1 lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile to 1 mL chlorobenzene. Finally, Au electrode was deposited on the HTM layer by thermal evaporation. The fabricated devices were left in a drying air for 12 h before test.\n",
      "For the fabrication of the mesoporous TiO2 solar cells, a compact TiO2 layer was first prepared by spin-coating an acidic solution of titanium isopropoxide in anhydrous ethanol on cleaned FTO substrates, followed by sintering at 500 C for 30 min. The TiO2 mesoporous layer was subsequently deposited on the compact layer by spin-coating a colloidal dispersion of TiO2 at 5000 rpm, and then sintering at 500 C for 30 min. The process of fabricating perovskite layer, HTM layer, and Au back electrode on TiO2 substrates is similar to the -Fe2O3-based solar cells.\n",
      "Synthesis and microscopic characterization. The CsPbI3 NCs were synthesized by a wet-chemistry method, following the slightly modified protocol described in refs39 and 41. We used a synthesis temperature of 180 C in order to steer the production towards NCs with a small band gap energy, i.e., larger size. Moreover, large NCs have a larger absorption cross section, and therefore are excited preferentially. We measured a photoluminescence quantum yield (PL QY) of 42.4  7 % at excitation of energy of 3.1 eV (400 nm, see Supplementary Fig. 1 for the excitation dependent PL QY), which is similar to previously reported values39,41, and is expected for NCs with a large size (the Bohr radius is ~6 nm for this material therefore the NCs are in the weak confinement regime). The structural characteristics of the NCs were determined using a state-of-the-art low-voltage monochromatic scanning transmission electron microscope (STEM) with a spatial resolution below 1.6 . Figure 1a shows the annular dark field STEM image of the drop-casted NCs with an average size of 11.5  0.6 nm (see also Supplementary Fig. 2 and detailed information in the Supplementary Information on materials and methods). A high-resolution annular dark field image of a 12 nm NC is shown in Fig. 1b. Here, the (nearly) cubic arrangement of the atoms is clearly observed, consistent with the perovskite structure. This is further analyzed by simultaneously performing energy dispersive X-ray spectroscopy (Fig. 1c) for elemental identification and core-loss electron energy loss spectroscopy (EELS, Fig. 1d). Mainly Cs, Pb and I are detected and the Au signal arises from the reflection of the TEM grid. The Cs:Pb:I ratio, determined from the quantification of the energy dispersive X-ray signal under the L-lines of the corresponding elements, is 1:1:3  10%, confirming that (mostly) NCs of CsPbI3 perovskite have been formed. At high losses, two distinctive peaks at 733 eV and 746 eV are observed, corresponding to CsM4.5, and the broader peak at 700 eV which corresponds to the delayed feature of the IM4.5 ionization edge. To determine the band gap of a single NC, imaging and valence-loss EELS collections were performed in parallel, with a high energy resolution (zero loss peak of PbM Cs:Pb:I = 1:1:3  10% ~50 meV)4446. In this way, the structural parameters of a single NC were determined, while simultaneously, its low-loss EEL spectrum was recorded. A characteristic step appears in the lowloss EEL spectrum, as an electron is excited from the top of the valence band to the conduction band, followed by a steady increase of the signal. This corresponds to the band-to-band absorption, whose magnitude grows as the density of states increases with energy, in analogy with optical absorption47. Fig. 1e shows the low-loss EEL spectrum with the characteristic step, and the simultaneously obtained annular dark field image of a 12 nm NCwhich somewhat appears at the edge of the size distribution (see also Supplementary Fig. 2) and has specifically been chosen because CM is expected to commence for large NCs first. A band gap energy of 1.77 eV is determined by taking the maximum of the first derivative of the spectrum around the absorption onset, as shown by the dotted line.\n",
      "Materials. The CsPbI3 NCs were synthesized following the protocol first reported by Protesescu et al. in 2015, applying a slight alteration39. To prepare the Cs-oleate, 0.814 g of Cs2CO3 is mixed with 40 mL of ODE and 2.5 mL of OA. The mixture is subsequently stirred at 150 C in an inert atmosphere until the reaction is complete. Here, the reactants are dried for 1 h at 120 C. To induce the formation of NCs, 5 mL of ODE and 0.188 mmol of PbI2 are dried in a N2 atmosphere for 1 h at 120 C. After water removal, 0.5 mL of dried OA and 0.5 mL of dried OLA are added to the reaction flask, increasing the temperature to 180 C. After the solvation of the PbI2 is complete, 0.4 mL of the Cs-oleate solution is injected (which is warmed up previously). The reaction takes a few seconds where after the NCs solution is cooled down quickly using an ice bath. The final product is purified using several centrifugation steps and is redispersed in hexane. The sample is diluted to reach the appropriate optical density (1 OD) for the spectroscopy experiments, and transferred to a quartz cuvette (UV grade).\n",
      "We fabricated perovskite solar cells with the above films, and found a very interesting result from the JV measurement (Figure 6). The best PCE was obtained from the perovskite film made of the TiO2 substrate which was exposed for 3 min in air. Voc and FF reached values of 1.0 V and 76%, respectively, though Jsc showed a lower value of 13.4 mA cm2; while other cells showed not only lower efficiencies but also displayed curves that were distorted from normal behavior. For the lowest PCE cell, Voc started at 0.82 V and gradually increased until the highest value of 1.0 V in the best devices. Then, it gradually decreased again to 0.83 V. A similar trend was also shown in the Jsc values. Based on our previous findings from the SEM analysis, we attribute these changes to the morphological change of PbI2 underlayers. The existence of PbI2 in all films is demonstrated by XRD analysis (Figure 6b). As expected, PbI2 peaks are detected in every film as discussed in Figure 2. However, it is noteworthy that the device performance can be changed extremely by the morphological change of the PbI2 underlayer. It is thought that a thicker and denser PbI2 layer limits the infiltration of MAI solution, hindering conversion of PbI2 to perovskite. The cell fabricated with the TiO2 substrate which was exposed in air for 30 s exhibited a highly distorted JV curve. It became less but it still showed an overshoot in the cell fabricated with the TiO2 substrate exposed for 1 min. On the contrary, the film seems to face another problem when the PbI2 film is too thin and not dense. The exposure of TiO2 layer under the perovskite layer would happen when the perovskite film was prepared with TiO2 substrates exposed in air for more than 5 min. Therefore, decrease of the PCE can be explained as the direct contact between TiO2 and spiro-OMeTAD.\n",
      "Device Fabrication: Chemically etched FTO glass (Nippon Sheet Glass) was cleaned with detergent solution, acetone, and ethanol. To form a 20 nm thick TiO2 blocking layer, diluted titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (TAA) solution (Sigma-Aldrich) in ethanol was sprayed at 450 C. Mesoporous-TiO2 layers were made by spin-coating a commercially available TiO2 paste (Dyesol 30NRD). Substrates were baked at 500 C for 30 min before the deposition of the perovskite layer. The two-step method was used to make the perovskite film. First, 1.0 M of PbI2 solution was prepared by mixing 461 mg of PbI2 (Aldrich) in 1 mL of DMF. The solution was stirred at 70 C for 30 min, and spin-coated at 6500 rpm for 20 s on TiO2 substrates, and the film was dried at 70 C for 15 min. The film was dipped in MAI solution (8 mg of MAI in 1 mL of IPA) for 20 s, rinsed with IPA and dried at 70 C for 5 min. The spiro-OMeTAD was spin-coated at 3000 rpm for 20 s before deposition of the 60 nm thick Au electrode by a thermal evaporation. The HTM solution was made by dissolving 72.3 mg of spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8 L of 4-tert-butylpyridine (TBP, Aldrich), 17.5 L of a stock solution of 520 mg mL1 of lithium bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile and 29 L of a stock solution of 300 mg mL1 of tris(2-(1Hpyrazol-1-yl)-4-tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)bis(trifluoromethylsulphonyl)imide in acetonitrile in 1 mL of chlorobenzene. All the preparative work to deposit PbI2, perovskite, and spiro-OMeTAD were done inside the drybox to minimize the influence of moisture while the controlled PbI2 films were prepared outside the drybox.\n",
      "In summary, we demonstrate an effective method to achieve high-performance printable mesoscopic perovskite solar cells via crystal reconstruction induced by the methylamine gas post-treatment. This process encouraged an efficient mor phology-healing behavior, resulting in uniform, compact, and crystalline perovskite films. As a result, the PCE of the MAPbI 3 PSC was significantly improved from 6.67 to 15.26%. Further more, we recovered the photodegraded MAPbI3 PSCs by the crystal reconstruction induced by the methylamine gas posttreatment. After two cycles of the photodegradation-recovery of the encapsulated MAPbI3 PSCs, the PCE recovered to 91% of the initial value after decomposed to ~40%, first realizing the regeneration of the perovskite solar cells on site without reconstructing or replacing any components, and providing a way to solve the environmental issues and unnecessary resource consuming.\n",
      "Device Fabrication: At first, the FTO conducting glass was etched with a laser to form the two desired electrode patterns, which was then ultrasonically cleaned with the detergent, deionized water, and ethanol in turn. Next, the compact TiO2 layer was deposit by spray pyrolysis deposition at 450 C with di-isopropoxy titanium bis (acetylacetonate) solution. Afterward, mesoscopic TiO2 layer, ZrO2 spacer layer, and carbon counter electrode were screen printed onto the substrate in sequence, sintered 40 min at 500, 500, 400 C, respectively. After cooling down to room temperature, the mesoporous layers were infiltrated with 1 m MAPbI3 precursor solution and annealed at 50 C for 2 h. The MAPbI3 precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 0.159 g CH3NH3I and 0.461 g PbI2 in 1 mL GBL. All the procedures above were completed in air.\n",
      "Synthesis and optical characterization. The CsPbBr3 NCs were synthesized using a one-step process based on direct tip sonication of precursor mixtures, according to our previously published work26. The purified dispersion of NCs exhibits an absorption spectrum characterized by a sharp absorption onset and a distinct excitonic peak at 500 nm (see Fig. 2a). The PL spectrum of the NCs deposited on a glass substrate shows a single PL emission peak centered around x = 523 nm, corresponding to an energy Ex = hx = 2.37 eV. A spectrometer with an integrating sphere detector was used to measure the absorbance of the NCs deposited on a substrate (Supplementary Fig. 1). The absorbance of the NCs distributed on a glass substrate resembles the absorbance in solution, indicating almost no absorption of the nanocrystals for excitation below the band-gap. The average size of the cubes was determined from transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images to be in the range of 1015 nm (Fig. 2b). These sizes along with the absorption and PL spectra clearly show that these NCs do not show quantum confinement, but have already bulk-like properties27,28. Moreover, from the TEM and the scanning electron microscopy (SEM) analysis (Fig. 2c), we observe that the NCs are mostly ordered on the substrate leading to a superlatticelike arrangement.\n",
      "Because of the rapid rise of the efficiency, perovskite solar cells are currently considered as the most promising next-generation photovoltaic technology. Much effort has been made to improve the efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells. Here, it is demonstrated that the addition of a novel organic cation of 2-(6-bromo-1,3-dioxo-1H-benzo[de]isoquinolin-2(3H)-yl)ethan-1-ammonium iodide (2-NAM), which has strong Lewis acid and base interaction (between CO and Pb) with perovskite, can effectively increase crystalline grain size and reduce charge carrier recombination of the double cation FA0.83MA0.17PbI2.51Br0.49 perovskite film, thus boosting the efficiency from 17.1  0.8% to 18.6  0.9% for the 0.1 cm2 cell and from 15.5  0.5% to 16.5  0.6% for the 1.0 cm2 cell. The champion cell shows efficiencies of 20.0% and 17.6% with active areas of 0.1 and 1.0 cm2, respectively. Moreover, the hysteresis behavior is suppressed and the stability is improved. The result provides a promising route to further elevate efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells by the fine tuning of triple organic cations.\n",
      "In conclusion, we introduce a new Lewis base organic component to fabricate the perovskite containing triple organic cations. The Lewis acid and base interaction between 2-NAM and perovskite enlarges the perovskite particle size, lengthens the TRPL lifetime, and suppresses the charge carrier recombination. As a result, the introduction of 2-NAM boosts the efficiency from 18.0% and 16.2% to 20.0% and 17.6% for the cells with areas of 0.1 and 1.0 cm2, respectively. Moreover, the hydrophobic self-assembled 2-NAM molecules at the grain effectively reduce the influence from moisture, thus enhancing the cell stability. Our results provide a promising route to further elevate efficiency and stability of perovskite solar cells by the fine tuning of triple organic cations.\n",
      "Giant 5PA from perovskite colloidal NCs. These halide perovskite colloidal NC samples (in toluene) were synthesized using various solution-processed approaches. Briefly, CsPbBr3 NCs (of sideB9 nm) were fabricated using a modified one-step technique39, while both the core-only MAPbBr3 NCs (diameterB8-9 nm) and the coreshell MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4 NCs (diameterB910 nm) were synthesized using the ligand-assisted reprecipitation method38see Methods and Supplementary Information for more details of the synthesis and the transmission electron microscopy images. The coreshell MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4 NCs possess a type-I conduction and valence band edge alignment between the core and shellsee schematic in Figure 1a, as validated by both photoelectron spectroscopy in air measurements and theoretical calculations (Supplementary Figures 1,2 and Supplementary Methods). The linear optical properties (that is, 1PA and one-photon-excited PLSupplementary Figure 1) of these halide perovskite NCs show clear signatures of excitonic and quantum confinement effects, where the larger blueshift in CsPbBr3 NCs stems from its larger Bohr diameter (dBB7 nm) compared to MAPbBr3 NCs (dBB4 nm), in agreement with literature reports (see Supplementary Methods for more details). Their PLQY areB84%,B92% andB55% for MAPbBr3, MAPbBr3/ (OA)2PbBr4 and CsPbBr3 NCs, respectively (see Supplementary Methods for details of the PLQY characterization). Figure 1b shows the five-photon-excited (that is, at 2,100 nm wavelength) excitonic PL emission (centred around 520 nm) from these samples with excitation fluence rangeB3.305.61 mJ cm 2 (inset) and their quintic excitation fluence dependence (inset). The 5PA excitation process via virtual energy levels is schematically illustrated in Figure 1c. Figure 1d shows the ultralarge Zs5 (and their corresponding s5 values (inset)) obtained through employing the s2 values at 800 nm measured by Z-scan40 (Supplementary Figures 3,4 and Supplementary Notes) as a standard and applying the calculation equations (see Supplementary Notes for details)41 for these halide perovskite colloidal NC samples over the infrared excitation wavelengths of 2,0502,300 nm. Record Zs5B10 136 cm10s4 photon 4 values are achieved with MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4 NCs4CsPbBr3 NCs4MAPbBr3 NCs (see Table 1), highlighting the significance of the (OA)2PbBr4 shell for enhancing the nonlinear optical absorption action cross-sections. All three samples follow a similar spectral dependence with Zs5 for MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4 NCsB68 times larger than MAPbBr3 NCs (see Table 1).\n",
      "To fabricate the coreshell multidimensional perovskite nanocrystals MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4, octylammonium bromide was first synthesized utilizing octylamine and Hydrobromic acid (HBr). Then, methylammonium bromide and octylammonium bromide with molar ratio of 8:2 were added to the precursor solution. The coreshell multidimensional perovskite NCs MAPbBr3/(OA)2PbBr4 were synthesized following the same synthetic procedures elaborated above. The coreshell NCs were formed through the co-precipitation of the mixed methylammonium and octylammonium bromide precursors. More details can be found in ref. 38.\n",
      "In addition, the colloidal CsPbBr3 nanocrystals with cubic shape and edge lengthB9 nm were synthesized following the reported modified one-step technique39. The steps are as follows: preparation of Cs-oleate precursor: 814 mg (2.5 mmol) of caesium carbonate (Cs2CO3) was mixed with 2.5 ml OAc and 40 ml 1-octadecene (ODE) in a 100 ml three-neck round bottom glass flask. At first, the mixed solution was dried by a vacuum pump for 1 h at 120 C. Then, the reaction mixture was heated under nitrogen environment for another 1 h at 150 C until all Cs2CO3 reacted with OA and becomes transparent. Cs-oleate precursor was preheated to 100 C before injection. Synthesis of cubic caesium lead bromide NCs: 69 mg (0.188 mmol) of PbBr2 was mixed in 5 ml ODE, 0.5 ml OAc and 0.5 ml oleylamine in a three-necked flask. The flask was dried under vacuum for 1 h at 120 C and degassed with nitrogen gas for another 1 h at same temperature. Cs-oleate precursor of 0.4 ml was injected into the main reaction solution at 170 C via syringe, yielding a bright green colloid NCs. The reaction was quenched with a ice bath for 30 s after the injection of the Cs-oleate precursor. The colloidal CsPbBr3 NCs was transferred to centrifuge tube with some acetonitrile. The mixture was centrifuged at relative centrifugal force of about 7587 g for 10 min and the precipitation was redispersed in toluene for further experiments. Sample characterization. Structural characterization of the as-synthesized nanocrystals was performed using both transmission electron microscopy (Jeol JEM-2010) and the X-ray diffraction (XRD Bruker D8 Advance). The concentrations of perovskite nanocrystals in toluene solution were determined by the mass of lead, which were measured by the inductively coupled plasma optical emission spectrometry (ICP-OES Optima 8000; Perkin-Elmer).\n",
      "In summary, we have established through epitaxially straining of SrCoO3 thin films that oxygen deficiencies in the cobaltite can be tailored from   0.1 to   0.25 in aqueous, highly oxidizing environments. These shifts in the oxygen content occur through modest amounts of tensile strain over 1%, resulting in anion concentrations not possible before in the unstrained bulk material. This newfound ability to control the oxygen vacancy concentration during the OER allows the enhancement of the cobaltites activity by more than an order of magnitude, commensurate with the catalytic performance of more expensive fully oxidized noble-metal electrodes such as IrO2. Such an increase in activity is likely due to the vacancies themselves or the resultant increase in Co3+, which in the intermediate spin state can act as an eg1 perovskite catalyst as first hypothesized by Suntivich et al.7 Moreover, this increase in activity is not accompanied by a decrease in structural or chemical stability, as found in other oxides reliant on cation rather than anion substitution.6a Consequently, the realization that strain can decouple the traditional relationship between oxygen and electrochemical operating conditions promises new functionalities in metal oxides for energy applications.\n",
      "         Planar Solar Cell Fabrication: A thin TiO2 compact layer was first formed on FTO (fluorine doped tin oxide) substrates using atomic layer deposition (10 nm, Cambridge Nanotech Savannah S100) using tetrakis-dimethyl-amido titanium and H2O as precursors. A lowconcentration TiCl4 treatment was used for interfacial improvement. The substrates were soaked in TiCl4 aqueous solution (120  103 M, 70 C) for 30 min and then annealed at 500 C for an additional 30 min. PCBM ([         \n",
      "Preparation of SnO2 Films: SnO2 was deposited by sputtering (Vacuum Sputter Deposition System, CAM-S, ULVAC). The SnO2 (4 N, Furuuchi Chemical) was deposited in a condition of 10 sccm O2/Ar mixture with a power of 60 W for 25 min. An oxygen-rich condition is necessary to ensure that the majority of Sn in the lfim is Sn 4+, while argon gas is typically required for plasma triggering. The oxygen ratio of 70%, 80%, 90%, and 100% were used while keeping the pressure inside the sputtering chamber at around 0.2 Pa. For different deposition rate, 40, 60, and 100 W were applied while keeping the deposition lfim with a thickness of 35 nm. Although even slower deposition rates might give better coverage, the time should also be considered. Here a deposition rate of 0.7 nm min1 (60 W) is chosen for further properties investigation. This sputtering deposition is promising for conformal coating.\n",
      "         Solar Cell/Module Fabrication: The glass/FTO with sheet resistance 7  / (OPVT) was sequentially washed with 1 wt% sodium dodecyl sulfate aqueous, deionized water, acetone, and isopropanol. After deposition of electron transport layer, the substrate was under UV-Ozone treatment for 15 min before use. For antisolvent deposition process, the solution of MAPbI3 (1.2 m ) was made by mixing PbI2 (TCI) and MAI (Dyesol) into a dimethylformamide (DMF) and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) mixed solvent (v/v = 7/1). For the MAPbI3 layer, the solution was cast onto substrates and spin coated at 2800 rpm for 25 s. After 7 s of spinning, 200  L of diethyl ether was drop cast onto the lfim. The MAPbI 3 lfim was formed after annealing at 100 C for 30 min in a 5% humidity box. For Cs0.06MA0.27FA0.67PbI2.7Br0.3, a two-step coating process was applied as reported.[         \n",
      "Device Fabrication: ITO-coated glass substrates (7  cm 2) were cleaned in soap, deionized water, and ethanol solution. Substrates were then subjected to oxygen plasma treatment for 15 min, followed by deposition of PEDOT:PSS (the hole transporting layer) (Clevios P VP Al 4083) via spin coating (4000 rpm for 60 s). Samples were annealed at 140 C for 10 min in air after which the perovskite films were spin coated (5000 rpm for 30 s) from equimolar precursor solutions and annealed at 100 C for 15 min under nitrogen environment to remove the solvent residue. Three types of precursor solutions were used, i.e., 1 m CH3NH3BrPbBr2, 1 m CH(NH2)2BrPbBr2 in DMF-DMSO mixture 1805454 (7 of 8) solvent (25% DMSO), and 0.5 m CsBrPbBr2 in DMSO solvent. Due to the low solubility of CsBr in the solvent, 0.5 m CsBr and 0.5 m PbBr2 in DMSO solvent was used to deposit CsPbBr3 film instead. In case of MA and FA systems, toluene was dripped for 25 s during spin coating to facilitate formation of compact films. 45 nm of Bphen was then thermally evaporated, followed by evaporation of 7 nm Calcium and 100 nm aluminum. All evaporation processes were carried out at a base pressure of 4  106 Torr with the active device area defined by shadow masks during calcium and aluminum evaporation. Devices were finally encapsulated using UV-curable epoxy and glass cover.\n",
      "Organicinorganic hybrid metal halide perovskite solar cells (PSCs) are attracting tremendous research interest due to their high solar-to-electric power conversion efficiency with a high possibility of cost-effective fabrication and certified power conversion efficiency now exceeding 22%. Although many effective methods for their application have been developed over the past decade, their practical transition to large-size devices has been restricted by difficulties in achieving high performance. Here we report on the development of a simple and cost-effective production method with high-temperature and short-time annealing processing to obtain uniform, smooth, and largesize grain domains of perovskite films over large areas. With high-temperature short-time annealing at 400 C for 4 s, the perovskite film with an average domain size of 1 m was obtained, which resulted in fast solvent evaporation. Solar cells fabricated using this processing technique had a maximum power conversion efficiency exceeding 20% over a 0.1 cm2 active area and 18% over a 1 cm2 active area. We believe our approach will enable the realization of highly efficient large-area PCSs for practical development with a very simple and short-time procedure. This simple method should lead the field toward the fabrication of uniform large-scale perovskite films, which are necessary for the production of high-efficiency solar cells that may also be applicable to several other material systems for more widespread practical deployment.\n",
      "There are several certified methods used to fabricate dense and uniform perovskite films with high quality, including vapor deposition, a vapor-assisted solution process, a two-step method, and solvent engineering with a nonpolar solvent.3234\n",
      "Among these methods, top performing PSCs are often fabricated via a one-step coating with a sequential nonpolar solvent (toluene or chlorobenzene) dropping method, which typically contains a solvent mixture of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) and dimethylformamide (DMF) or -butyrolactone (GBL).8,30 To date, most studies have focused on the perovskite precursor composition or how to vary the depositing solution process to obtain high-performance power conversion efficiencies (PCEs).27,29,30 However, few studies have examined the effects of annealing temperature on the morphology of perovskite films. Eperon et al. investigated the relationship between the annealing temperature and perovskite coverage over the temperature range of 90 to 170 C.16 The effect of annealing temperature (60 to 200 C) on film morphology was also studied by Dualeh et al., while Xu et al. reported that a lowtemperature (<100 C) gradual annealing approach is very effective for fabricating high-performance PSCs.35 However, to our knowledge, there are no reports on the properties of perovskite films annealed at temperatures above 200 C. This gap in the literature can be attributed to the fact that perovskite films readily decompose into PbI2 or residuum when exposed to low temperatures for long times and, more pertinently, to high temperatures for short times. As such thermal decomposition or PbI2 excess formation adversely affects the PCEs, traditionally low-temperature annealing (usually 100 C) for an optimized time has been preferred to make a large domain and crystal size of perovskite films.40\n",
      "The perovskite film fabricated by different annealing temperatures also affects the light absorption properties. The ultravioletvisible (UVvis) absorption spectra of perovskite films fabricated under the different annealing temperature conditions are shown in Figure S3. The perovskite films prepared by HTSA-100 processing showed weak absorption bands over the range 300 to 800 nm. The absorption intensities of the perovskite films slowly increased with increasing annealing temperature. Accordingly, the strongest absorption was obtained from perovskite films formed under HTSA-400 conditions, most likely due to the uniform and compact surface coverage.\n",
      "We fabricated planar-type PSCs using an alternative thermal annealing process using perovskite films composed of (FAPbI3)0.85(MAPbBr3)0.15 as a light absorber and investigated the photovoltaic (PV) metrics of the devices by evaluating their photocurrent density versus voltage (JV) curves and the external quantum efficiency (EQE) and integrated JSC of the corresponding devices. The devices had the structure FTO/ blocking layer(bl)-TiO2(50 nm)/perovskite(650 nm)/SpiroOMeTAD(300 nm)/Au(80 nm). Table S1 lists the statistical data of the PSC PV metrics (0.1 cm2 active area). As shown in Figure 2a, HTSA-400 processing improved the device performance greatly and reproducibly in comparison to HTSA-100 processing. The average PCE for 20 control PSCs produced by HTSA-100 was 16.99  0.46%, with an average short-current photocurrent density (JSC) of 22.05  0.02 mA cm2, an opencircuit voltage (VOC) of 1.09  0.02 mV, and a fill factor (FF) of 70.66  1.86%. For HTSA-400-processed solar cells, the average PCE improved to 20.14  0.36%, with an average JSC of 23.41  0.32 mA cm2, a VOC of 1.127  0.007 mV, and an FF of 76.38  1.17%. The significant performance improvement afforded by HTSA-400 processing is reflected in the values for all of the PV metrics. In Table 1, the JV curves for the best cell fabricated by different annealing processes are summarized. The best cells, in terms of performance, fabricated by HTSA400 processing gave a PCE of 20.75%, corresponding to JSC = 23.60 mA cm2, VOC = 1.129 mV, and FF = 77.88% under standard AM 1.5 solar illumination. Figure 2b shows the EQE spectrum for two of the best-performing devices prepared with HTSA-100 and HTSA-400 when illuminated with monochromatic light over a wavelength range of 300 to 900 nm. The HTSA-400 processing achieved much higher EQE values than the HTSA-100 processing, in agreement with the differences obtained for the device photocurrents from these two processing approaches. Integration of the EQE spectrum in the range of solar emission yields AM 1.5 photocurrents of 22.3 and 20.1 mA cm2 for the HTSA-400 and HTSA-100 devices, respectively, which is in agreement with the measured JSC values, within a 5% mismatch. Such a high JSC for HTSA-400 may also be related to the stronger UVvis absorption of the perovskite films (Figure S3).\n",
      "These results indicate that the larger grain size and uniformity of the perovskite films can also affect the stability of perovskite solar cells. Such an improvement of performance with increasing annealing temperature may be related to the increase in grain size and associated reduction in the number of grain boundaries. The enlarged perovskite domain size and improved crystalline quality may reduce the overall bulk defect density, thus suppressing charge trapping during solar cell operation.36 Furthermore, the large grain size could contribute to the maintenance of the electronhole separation and block the recombination pathway from bl-TiO2 to the holetransporting material (HTM), resulting in an appreciable improvement in the PCEs.37\n",
      "Another advantage of the HTSA processing approach is that the perovskite films can be fabricated with high uniformity over a large area. To test this, we measured the PCEs with 0.1 and 1 cm2 active areas for the HTSA-100 and HTSA-400 films (see Tables S1 and S2). Figure 4a and b show a histogram of the PCEs for the perovskite solar cells fabricated through HTSA100 processing with 0.1 and 1 cm2 active areas, respectively. The mean PCE of the 0.1 cm2 active area was 16.99%, whereas a mean PCE of 12.66% (best 13.82%) was obtained for the 1 cm2 active area (Figure 4c and Table S1). The main contributing factor to decreasing PCE is FF, which is caused by poor uniformity in the perovskite films. However, for perovskite solar cells prepared through the high-temperature annealing process, a mean PCE of 20.14% was obtained over the 0.1 cm2 active area, with a corresponding mean of 17.59% (best 18.32 %) obtained over the 1 cm2 active area (Figure 4d and Table S2). Such a high efficiency with a 1 cm2 active area is comparable to the highest values reported in the literature.38,39 The ability of the cells based on HTSA-400 films to maintain a high PCE as the active area is increased from 0.1 cm2 to 1 cm2 may derive from the high uniformity of the HTSA-400 perovskite films, which exhibit long-range, single-crystallinelike domains. For example, in the cross-sectional SEM images of the HTSA-100 and HTSA-400 perovskite films in Figure 4e and f, it can be observed that multiple grains are connected with each other in the low-temperature annealed HTSA-100 device, whereas the grains in the HTSA-400 films are so large that a single-crystalline-like grain can connect the upper and lower electrodes. These results suggest that the large-area uniformity in the HTSA-400 film may contribute to the greater cell efficiency of devices based on such films.\n",
      "In summary, we examined high-temperature-annealed perovskite films prepared using a short-time annealing process with a view to improving the maximum power conversion efficiency of perovskite solar cells. Uniform perovskite films with large domain sizes were produced via the HTSA approach. By applying the simple annealing process of 400 C for 4 s, largegrain size and uniform perovskite films were successfully deposited on the substrates. Scanning electron microscopy (SEM) images confirmed that the average domain size gradually increased from 300 nm to 1 m as the annealing temperature was increased from 100 C to 400 C, respectively. Furthermore, this annealing process produced perovskite films with high uniformity over large areas. Such a large area of relative uniformity meant that the PCE did not greatly diminish even when the active area was increased from 0.1 cm2 to 1 cm . 2 In addition, the large grain domains were found to play a crucial role in improving the carrier lifetime, in the suppression of nonradiative recombination at the grain boundary, and in the effective extraction of charge carriers at the interface between perovskite and selective contacts. These results constitute an important development toward the commercialization of PSCs.\n",
      "Preparation of the Perovskite Precursors. Formamidinium acetate, hydriodic acid (57% in water with a stabilizer), hydrobromic acid (48% in water), and methylamine (40% in methanol) were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, Fluka, and TCI. Formamidinium iodide (FAI) was synthesized as reported elsewhere. Briefly, 15 g of formamidine acetate was reacted with 30 mL of hydriodic acid in a 100 mL round-bottomed flask at 0 C for 1 h with stirring. Methylamine bromide (MABr) was also synthesized by combining 27.86 mL of methylamine and 44 mL of hydriodic acid in a 250 mL roundbottomed flask at 0 C for 2 h with stirring. From the solution, a light yellow colored precipitate was obtained by evaporating the solutions at 70 C for 1 h. The resulting products were dissolved in ethanol and precipitated using diethyl ether. This procedure was repeated until white powers were obtained and then recrystallized from ethanol and diethyl ether with slow gas diffusion over 3 days. After recrystallization, the resulting powders were collected and dried at 60 C for 24 h. The other organic cations were purchased from Dyesol, and lead salts were bought from TCI. Spiro-OMeTAD and FK209 were purchased from EM-Index.\n",
      "Solar Cell Fabrication. Five-mm-patterned FTO glass (Pilkington, TEC-8, 8  sq1) was washed with 10% Deconex solution and cleaned with deionized water, acetone, ethanol, and isopropyl alcohol for 10 min each in an ultrasonic bath, before being exposed to a UVO cleaner for 15 min. An electron transfer layer of TiO2 was deposited on the cleaned FTO substrates using air spray pyrolysis. Titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) (20 mM) in an ethanol solution was coated on the FTO glass at 450 C for 10 min, sintered at 450 C for 1 h, and slowly cooled to ambient temperature. This procedure gives a blocking layer of anatase TiO2 with a thickness of around 50 60 nm. Prior to perovskite deposition, the substrates were exposed on a UVO cleaner for 15 min. The perovskite precursor solutions were prepared by mixing FAI (1.2 M), PbI2 (1.32 M), MABr (0.18 M), and PbBr2 (0.18 M) in anhydrous DMF/DMSO = 4:1 (v/v). The perovskite precursor solution was spin coated in a two-step method at 2000 rpm for 5 s followed by 6000 rpm for 20 s. During the second step, 1 mL of toluene was poured onto the spinning substrate slowly prior to the end of the procedure. The substrates were then annealed at 100 C for 30 min, 200 C for 1 min, 300 C for 8 s, and 400 C for 4 s, respectively. After perovskite film annealing, the substrates were cooled for 10 min, and a hole transfer layer was spin coated at 4000 rpm for 10 s. A Spiro-OMeTAD (EM index) in chlorobenzene (7 mM) was mixed with 33.8 L of a 4-tert-butylpyridine additive and 19.6 L of a Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide solution (520 mg/ 1 mL acetonitrile) before adding suitable tris(2-(1H-pyrazol-1-yl)-4tert-butylpyridine)cobalt(III)tris(bis(trifluoromethylsulfonyl)imide) (FK209, Dyesol). Finally, a Au counter electrode (70 nm) was deposited by thermal evaporation under high vacuum.\n",
      "For a short conclusion, we believe that the quasi-Fermi level pinning is the physical origin of the high VOC of the integrated perovskite/BHJ solar cell. There are certainly other side factors that will contribute to the open circuit voltage. One possible reason could be the morphological difference between PCBM and BHJ film. PCBM is a small molecule with a tendency to aggregate. Thus, the PCBM film might not be sufficient to cover the perovskite surface, which results in severe charge recombination loss on the cathode side. By blending with the polymer, the bulk heterojunction should be able to form a conformal and continuous film to separate the metal cathode and perovskite. Thus, the low charge recombination velocity in the BHJ film, as discussed before, results in a slightly higher VOC.\n",
      "Moreover, we believe that the unique configurational and material properties of this perovskite/BHJ structure make it possible for the quasi-Fermi level to pin to that of perovskite.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have demonstrated high-performance integrated perovskite/BHJ solar cells and found that the improved performance is ascribed to the low carrier recombination rate, high VOC and increased light absorption ability in NIR region of integrated devices. The key finding of the present work is that the VOC of the integrated device is dominated by (or pinned to) the perovskite cells, not the OPV cells. We showed for the first time a quasi-Fermi Level Pinning Model to understand the working principles of this integrated device and to demonstrate the physical origin of the VOC of the integrated perovskite/BHJ solar cell. The VOC of the integrated cell is determined by the quasi-Fermi level splitting of the biabsorption layer system, which are pinned to that of the perovskite layer. Such quasi-Fermi level pinning is an outcome of the uniqueness of the perovskite/BHJ configuration and distinct material properties of the two layers and accounts for the fact that perovskite, the one which delivers higher VOC of the two layers, dominates the open circuit voltage of the integrated solar cell. It should be noted that the Fermi energy pinning model is one of the models we have to explain the abnormal large VOC in this type of solar cells, while it does not exclude other possible models which is still in the development.\n",
      "On the basis of our findings, the integrated device always provides additional light harvesting in the NIR without sacrificing VOC; more enhanced PCEs of 20% or higher are expected by integrating more efficient perovskite layers with the optimized NIR polymer-based BHJ layers, thus paving a new way to further enhance the performance of perovskite solar cells and suggesting a new direction to high-performance photovoltaic device for future industry application.\n",
      "To conclude, BGLC-based PCEs can be operated at a lower temperature and high Faradaic efficiency, while the tubular geometry enables simple heat and process integration as well as low-cost cell fabrication and peripherals. As a consequence, the results presented herein demonstrate the potential of PCE technology as a costcompetitive alternative for large-scale energy storage and pressurized H2 production, especially when renewable or industrial waste heat is available. a 100 ) 75 % ( y c n e i iffc 50 e c i a d a r aF 25\n",
      "Colloidal synthesis of CsPbBr3 perovskite NPLs was carried out by modifying the nanocrystal synthesis reported by Protesescu et al.6a in which they demonstrated size control of nanometer sized cubes by varying the temperature from 140 to 200 C. We have discovered that reactions at lower temperatures between 90 and 130 C tend to strongly favor asymmetric growth producing quasi 2D geometries. NPLs were synthesized using standard air-free techniques. PbBr2 was solubilized in octadecene (ODE) with oleic acid and oleylamine, and then Csoleate was injected at elevated temperatures (90130 C) to form NPLs.\n",
      "After successful synthesis of CH3NH3PbI3xClx by the twostep solution process, the third type of OITP-CEMJ photodetectors was then fabricated by randomly distributing CH3NH3PbI3xClx nanocrystals onto SWNT nanoelectrodes with gap length of about 10 nm (Figure 4c,d, inset and Figure S23b, inset, Supporting Information). Remarkably, higher responsivity (107109 A W1) and higher detectivity (10151016 Jones) were obtained in these OITP-CEMJ photodetectors (Figure 4c,d and Figure S24, Supporting Information). In addition to a slight increase of the ON/OFF current ratio and LDR (Figure 4e,f, Supporting Information), it is interesting to observe that when the VDS decreased, the ON/OFF current ratio continued to increase. This phenomenon can only be observed in chlorine-doped OITP devices (Figure S25a,b, Supporting Information). As a result, when a small bias was applied, the LDR value increased to 91 dB without a substantial decrease of R and D* (Figure S25d,f, Supporting Information). It is foreseeable that the ON/OFF current ratio and LDR value would be even higher when VDS becomes lower than 10 mV, and this could be proved by further experiments if the noise limit of the semiconducting parameter analyzer is below the femtoampere level. As predicted by Formula (2), the photogain of this third type of OITP-CEMJ photodetectors approached as high as 5.3  109, and the photogain maintained larger than 109 in a broad wavelength range (Figure 4g). Similarly, these devices could behave as photoconductors with unsaturated trend (Figure 4h and Figure S26, Supporting Information) when compared to the devices formed from gold electrodes with 1705589 (7 of 11) gap length of micrometers (Figures S22 and S27, Supporting Information). The detection limit of the device is lower than 0.085 aW, which reaches the radiation energy level of a single photon per second (Figure S24, Supporting Information). The similar physical mechanism of this type of OITP-CEMJ photodetectors is shown in Figures S23 and S28 (Supporting Information), which is also confirmed by control experiments (Figure S29, Supporting Information).\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated that OITP is an efficient active material and CEMJ is a mature device platform for highperformance photodetector fabrication. By incorporating OITP material and CEMJ technology into a single electrical circuit, highest responsivity, highest photogain, high detectivity, high LDR, and a broad detection wavelength range were achieved simultaneously through synergistic mechanisms of both photodiode and photoconductor. In particular, the ultrahigh quantum efficiency implies that OITP-CEMJ photodetectors are sensitive to small photon numbers, providing a promising potential to achieve single-photon detectors operating at room temperature and low driving voltage. Furthermore, these OITP-CEMJ photodetectors with high performance in almost every figure of merit are compatible with conventional complementary metal oxide semiconductor technologies. This compatibility might open exciting opportunities for a wide variety of immediate practical applications, such as logic circuits, charge-coupled devices, collimation, telecommunications, biomedical imaging, information security, and optical quantum computation.\n",

      "Halide perovskites (PVSK) have attracted much attention in recent years due to their high potential as a next generation solar cell material. To further improve perovskites progress toward a state-of-the-art technology, it is desirable to create a tandem structure in which perovskite may be stacked with a current prevailing solar cell such as silicon (Si) or Cu(In,Ga)(Se,S)2 (CIGS). The transparent top electrode is one of the key components as well as challenges to realize such tandem structure. Herein, we develop a multilayer transparent top electrode for perovskite photovoltaic devices delivering an 11.5% efficiency in top illumination mode. The transparent electrode is based on a dielectric/metal/dielectric structure, featuring an ultrathin gold seeded silver layer. A four terminal tandem solar cell employing solution processed CIGS and perovskite cells is also demonstrated with over 15% efficiency.\n",
      "In summary, we have successfully demonstrated a multilayer transparent top electrode for hybrid halide perovskite solar cells. The electrode employs the conventional dielectric/metal/dielectric structure featuring an ultrathin gold seeding layer underneath the silver layer. The gold seeded silver film shows significantly improved conductivity and optical transparency compared with pristine Ag or Au due to modification of the wetting properties of the metal deposition. The semitransparent perovskite solar cell illuminated from this multiplayer top electrode performs well with 11.5% efficiency and exhibits almost no loss of Voc and FF compared with the regular device. This perovskite top cell was further connected with a solution processed CIGS bottom cell and measured as a four terminal tandem device, delivering a combined power conversion efficiency 15.5%. Our work not only demonstrates a simple processing method for a transparent top electrode of perovskite solar cells, but also shows a promising route to further improve current solar cell efficiency through the use of tandem perovskite/CIGS solar cell structures. the approaches described elsewhere.15 All the chemicals were used as received without any further purification including PbI2 (99.999%, Sigma-Aldrich), HI (57 wt % in water, Aldrich), HCl, CH3NH2 (33 wt % in absolute ethanol, Sigma-Aldrich), TiCl4, titanium diisopropoxide bis(acetylacetonate) 75% in isopropyl alcohol (TiAcac, Sigma-Aldrich), spiro-OMeTAD (Lumtec), dimethylformamide (DMF), Li-bis(trifluoromethanesulfonyl) imide (Li-TFSI, Sigma), diethyl ether, acetone, isopropyl alcohol, acetonitrile, ethanol, 2-methoxyethanol, and benzyl alcohol. ITO or glass substrates (for PL measurements) were sequentially washed with isopropyl alcohol, acetone, distilled water and ethanol. The ETL was subsequently coated on ITO substrates with a TiAcac stabilized TiO2 solution and annealed at 150 C for 30 min in air. PbI2 (dissolved in DMF, 400 mg/mL) was spincoated on top of ITO/TiO2 substrate at 2500 rpm for 30 s. Then dissolved in 2-propanol, a mixture of MAI/MACl (50 mg/mL, 5 mg/mL) was spin-coated on top of the dried PbI2 layer at room temperature at 2000 rpm for 30 s in the dry air (at Dew Point of 70 C). All of the films were annealed in the air at 135 C for desired time. A hole transport layer (HTL) solution was coated on the perovskite film at 3000 rpm for 30 s, where a spiroOMeTAD/chlorobenzene (90 mg/1 mL) solution was employed with addition of 45 L of Li-TFSI/acetonitrile (170 mg/1 mL) and 10 L of tBP. Finally, the counter electrode was deposited by thermal evaporation of gold under a pressure of 5 10 5 Torr. The active area was 0.108 cm2. The as-fabricated reference device depicts from the bottom to the top, the 150 nm thick ITO electrode, 40 nm of TiO2, 350 nm of perovskite, 200 nm of spiro-OMeTAD, and 100 nm of gold. The fabrication of solution processed CIGS solar cell follows previous work demonstrated in this study.43 The transparent top electrode based device adopts all the device fabrication parameters as the reference device except replacing the Au electrode by multilayer top electrodes. The MoOx/Au/Ag/MoOx multilayer top electrode is deposited subsequently with thermal evaporation method, with the thickness of 10, 1, 10, and 40 nm, respectively. The evaporation rates for each layer are 0.1, 0.02, 0.1, and 0.1 nm/s, respectively.\n",
      "Inspired by the long-lived ASE, we fabricated a second-order DFB laser by depositing a similar, ~120-nm-thick MAPbI3 film onto a  = 385 nm period grating etched into a thin alumina layer on a high-thermal-conductivity sapphire substrate. This particular structure is designed to support the fundamental transverse electric (TE0) mode with a modal effective index that satisfies the Bragg feedback condition at the peak of the tetragonal-phase ASE spectrum. Figure 2a shows a cross-sectional scanning electron micrograph of a typical sample, highlighting the low surface roughness of the MAPbI3 film enabled by our solvent exchange deposition process15.\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated second-order MAPbI3 DFB lasers that operate c.w. for over an hour above optical pumping thresholds of ~17 kW cm2 and at temperatures below the tetragonal-to-orthorhombic phase transition (T < 160 K). Continuous gain originates from tetragonal-phase inclusions that are photogenerated by the pump within the bulk orthorhombic host matrix on a submicrosecond timescale. More work is required to fully understand why this mixed-phase arrangement avoids the lasing death phenomenon that occurs for pure tetragonal phase MAPbI3 at T > 160 K, but our results suggest that engineering perovskite gain media to mimic the same hostguest energy level scheme2729 may be a useful strategy in the pursuit of an electrically pumped perovskite laser diode.\n",
      "Fabrication. DFB gratings were created by first depositing an 80-nm-thick Al2O3 layer onto a sapphire substrate, followed by a 100-nm-thick layer of S1805 photoresist, which was patterned using interference lithography as described previously4. eTh gratings were developed and hard-baked at 150 C for 5 min, followed by a wet etch in 85% H2PO4 for 50 s at 68 C to transfer the pattern into the underlying Al2O3. Methylammonium iodide (MAI) was synthesized by mixing aqueous HI (Aldrich) with equimolar methylamine (ethanol solution, Aldrich) for 2 h at 0 C. eTh MAI was then purified by recrystallization from a hot isopropanol:toluene (1:4) mixture. eTh MAPbI 3 active layer was subsequently deposited onto the gratings by spin-coating a 0.65 M solution of stoichiometric MAI/PbI2 (Alfa) in dimethylformamide at 5,200 r.p.m. eTh solution was filtered with a 200 nm polytetraufloroethylene filter before spinning. To obtain a smooth iflm of high optical quality, solvent exchange was performed by pipetting 0.5 ml of toluene at 4 s aeftr starting the spinning, which results in the formation of nanocrystallites and ~4 nm r.m.s. roughness. eTh films were dried for ~5 min on a hot plate and stored in the dark in N2 during the several months it took to complete the laser characterization.\n",
      "In summary, by dissolving functional conjugated polymer in antisolvent to treat the spinning perovskite film, we have demonstrated an efficient and universal protocol for fabricating perovskite solar cells with simultaneously enhanced efficiency and longevity. The conjugated polymers exhibit less effect on the grain size of perovskite crystal but are beneficial for achieving improved charge transport along multiple-direction perovskite crystals. The presence of thin conjugated polymer layer can be observed evidently on the top surface of perovskite film through SEM measurements, which plays an important role in optimizing the morphology, surface passivation, and turning the 1706377 (7 of 10) surface to hydrophobic one. All these aspects govern the device efficiency and long-term stability. More importantly, we have shown that through molecular fluorination, the polymers can further strengthen these effects. Through optimizing the concentration of conjugated polymer in antisolvent, an improved PCE of 18.4% and 18.7% was achieved for n-type polymer PF-1 and n-type F-N2200, respectively, in comparison with PCE of 17.7% for the control device. Meanwhile, the remarkable enhancement of the device stability is more attractive for the future commercialization of perovskite solar cells. We believe that the core function of conjugated polymer is a thin protection layer regardless of energy levels, absorption, crystallinity, 1706377 (8 of 10) and p-type/n-type properties. Considering the vast selection of conjugated polymer materials and easy functional design, our work may provide a facile, versatile, and universal way to fabricate efficient and stable perovskite solar cells.\n",
      "Fabrication and Characterization of Perovskite Solar Cells: PSCs were fabricated with a structure of uflorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/TiO 2/MAPbI3/ spiro-OMeTAD/Au. The FTO glass substrates was ultrasonically cleaned and treated with UVozone for 20 min. The TiO2 lfims were deposited onto the substrates by the hydrothermal method. Before the deposition of the perovskite lfims, a 10 min UVozone was carried. The MAPbI 3 perovskite lifms were deposited through a one-step spin-coating process, with antisolvent dripping. CH3NH3I and PbI2 was dissolved in dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) and -butyrolactone (99.9%, Alfa Aesar) (3:7, v/v) at 1.2 m and stirring in room temperature for 4 h. The MAPbI3 precursor solution was coated onto the TiO2 substrate and spun at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 10 and 40 s, respectively. The antisolvent process was utilized to make the perovskite lfims with a better morphology and crystallization, in which 120  L of chlorobenzene w/wo conjugated polymer was swiftly dripped onto the substrate 20 s preliminary to the end of the program during the high-speed spin-coating step. Conjugated polymers with different concentration were dissolved in the chlorobenzene and stirred for 4 h at 45 C before antisolvent process. The substrate was then dried at 100 C for 10 min. The solution of spiro-OMeTAD was spin coated on the MAPbI3 lfims at 5000 rpm for 30 s before a 100 nm of Au was deposited by thermal evaporation under vacuum of 2  106 mbar.

      "Synthesis of Electron Transport Layers on Large Area Substrates. Three types of ETLs were synthesized on large area precleaned conducting glass substrates, FTO (5.7 cm 5.7 cm2 purchased from Solaronix, sheet resistance 15 /0): (i) ETL employing TiO2 nanorods, (ii) compact TiO2 layer via TiCl4 solution treatment (CL), and (iii) ETL employing TiO2 nanoparticle as a scaffold (NPs). Rutile nanorods were prepared as reported elsewhere.33 In brief, DI water and HCl (37%) were mixed (60 mL/60 mL) and magnetically stirred for 10 min followed by addition of 2.4 mL of titanium isopropoxide until a clear solution was obtained. FTOs were placed in an autoclave containing a Teflon socket with conducting side facing down at an angle 45 and kept at 150 C for 4 5 h in an electric oven to achieve a desired thickness of TiO2 NRs. Two types of photoanode architectures were obtained for NRs: (i) NRs were directly grown on FTO (single-layer architecture) and labeled D1 (FTO/NR); and (ii) an intermediate layer was grown on the FTO via TiCl4 treatment as described in literature,34 which was then placed in an autoclave for NR growth (double layer) and was labeled D2 (FTO/IL/NR).\n",
      "To fabricate devices employing TiO2 NPs, a compact layer was deposited by spray pyrolysis technique on the glass FTO substrates. A TiO2 NP paste was then deposited by screen printing and sintered to obtain a 500 nm thick mesoporous TiO2 layer. Thickness of the ETLs was measured using a surface profilometer (Dektak Veeco 150).\n",
      "We have fabricated CH3NH3PbI3 xClx-based solar modules employing vertically aligned TiO2 nanorods as an electron transport layer via precise laser patterning and interfacial engineering. Fabrication of an intermediate thin TiO2 layer between FTO and NRs facilitated their patterning for module fabrication without damaging the conducting oxide layer. The NR modules showed not only significantly higher power conversion efficiency (10.5%, av. 8.1%) compared to the planar (CL, 5.8%, av. 4.9%) architecture and even nanoparticle (NP, 7.9%, av. 5.4%) analogue with the same scaffold thickness but also, more importantly, a higher shelf-life durability. The source of stable performance in NR modules investigated via XRD, absorption, and IPCE studies shows that perovskite has a phase stability on NRs better than that of their particle analogues, most likely due to their macroporous nature compared to mesoscopic NPs. laser emitting at  = 1064 nm. First, we insulated sequential cells by ablating both FTO and ETL with a repetition rate of 30 kHz at an applied fluence of 4.5 J cm 2, and then we removed the ETL from the area where the FTO makes contact with the counter electrode of the successive cell. The laser parameters were optimized to remove NRs from the FTO surface.\n",
      "nanoparticles, we employ the laser printing method.21 In this approach, nanoparticles are fabricated from a perovskite thin film in the forward-transfer geometry, when the receiving substrate is placed under the film with a spacing of 50 m. For a film, a solution of perovskite precursor (MAPbI3) is prepared in a drybox as follows: methylammonium iodide (MAI) in butyrolactone with dimethyl sulfoxide (GBL/DMSO) at the concentration of 1.5 M is used to dissolve 1.5 M of lead iodine (PbI2). The solution is stirred and heated (70 C) overnight and used after filtration through 0.45 m PTFE syringe filter. For depositing, a perovskite layer is created by a solventengineering technique inside the drybox, including two step spin-coating process.22 At the first step, a solution precursor MAPbI3 is deposited at rotation speed 1000 rpm. The second step is dripping 200 L of toluene at 3000 rpm, which does not dissolve perovskite during the film formation. Each film is annealed at 100 C for 10 min.22 Glass substrates are washed by sonication in deionized water, toluene, acetone, and isopropanol. Despite low cost and simplicity, this method allows for the formation of high-quality films emitting light with high quantum yield (up to 70%).23 The perovskite nanoparticles are fabricated by employing Yb3+ femtosecond laser pulses at  = 1050 nm with energy around 50 nJ focused by 10 objective (NA = 0.26). Morphology and size of the nanoparticles are studied by scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with an electron microscope (Crossbeam 1540 XB, Carl Zeiss). According to our data, the size of nanoparticles is in the range of 50500 nm, their shape is quasi-spherical with some facets, whereas their position on a receiving substrate is random (for details, see Supporting Information).\n",
      "Conclusion. We have proposed a novel type of light-emitting nanoantennas made of hybrid perovskites which demonstrate enhanced photoluminescence normalized to volume due to a coupling of excitons to Mie resonances. The observed enhancement is up to 5-fold between various nanoparticles and up to 2-fold as compared with a thin perovskite film. We have also demonstrated that optical properties of the perovskite nanoantennas can be changed in the range of 530770 nm by a simple variation of their composition. Moreover, high defects tolerance of halide perovskites allows for creation of lightemitting nanoantennas even by the high throughput laser printing method involving strong heating and fast cooling of the target material. Our results pave the way toward new optoelectronics applications of nanophotonics based on halide perovskite materials.\n",

      "In summary, the light-induced degradation of the layered perovskite (PEA)2PbI4 has been investigated. By exposing the crystalline flakes to a laser, we observed the evolution of the structure from (PEA)2PbI4 to PbI2. Upon resonant photoexcitation, volatile organic cations start to diffuse out from the edges, and at the surface where the inorganic layers are broken down. Our comparative CLSM study under laser scanning with different wavelengths suggests that above-gap photoexcitation plays an important role in triggering the breakdown of the framework of (PEA)2PbI4. The light-induced degradation can be significantly suppressed by an efficient encapsulation design using 2D semiconductors and/or polycarbonates. These results afford unprecedented opportunities for combining layered perovskites with other 2D materials and thereby customizing new functionalities in van der Waals heterostructures.\n",
      "In summary, we have demonstrated a self-powered gradient O-doped CdS/perovskite hybrid photodetectors. Employing the gradient-O CdS nanorod array as electron transport layer, the photodetector exhibits largely enhanced responsivity, detectivity, and response speed as compared to the pure CdS. Through adjusting the O concentration along the radius direction of CdS nanorods, the associated optimum gradient energy band bending leads to high performance with the responsivity and detectivity of 0.48 A W1 and 2.1  1013 Jones. The enhancement mechanism is explored and mainly attributed to the fact that the continuous built-in band bending promotes the separation and reduces the recombination of photogenerated charges at the interface of gradient-O CdS/perovskite. Our investigations contribute to the in-depth understanding of the effect of gradient energy band on optoelectronic devices and provide a new energy band engineering strategy to design highperformance self-powered photodetectors.\n",

      "Fabrication of Self-Powered Photodetectors: In the first step, the perovskite layer was coated onto the as-prepared gradient-O CdS nanorods. In brief, 0.461 g lead iodide (PbI2) was added into 1 mL N,N-dimethylformamide to prepare PbI2 precursor solution. 0.1 g methylammonium iodide (MAI) was added into 2 mL isopropanol (99.5%, Aladdin) to prepare MAI precursor solution. Then 50  L PbI2 precursor solution was spin coated on the substrate at 3000 rpm for 30 s. At the spin coating time of 10 s, 50  L MAI precursor solution was immediately added to the substrate, followed by stewing on a plate for 30 min at room temperature to remove the residual solvent and then heating on the 150 C hot plate to get highly crystalline perovskite layer. After cooling down to room temperature, SpiroOMeTAD was spin coated on the perovskite film at 2000 rpm for 30 s. www.advmat.de The Spiro-OMeTAD solution was prepared by dissolving 72.3 mg of Spiro-OMeTAD, 28.8  L of 4-tert-butylpyridine, and 17.5  L of lithium bis-(trifluoromethanesulfonyl)imide (Li-TFSI) (520 mg Li-TFSI in 1 mL acetonitrile, 99.8%, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL of chlorobenzene (99.9%, Alfa Aesar).

      "We have demonstrated that the deposition of MAPbI3 from PbCl2 + 3MAI proceeds via the crystalline precursor MA2PbI3Cl and that the transformation to perovskite is governed by the evaporation of MACl. This particular combination of precursor and rate-limiting-step creates a self-regulating mechanism, leading to slow formation of the perovskite. Thus, the PbCl2derived processing method imparts two distinct benefits to the perovskite film. First, the deposition of a stable precursor prevents rapid perovskite crystallization upon solvent drying, allowing the formation of a compact film without voids or pinholes. Second, the self-regulating release of MACl dramatically slows the transformation of precursor to perovskite, which may lead to high crystalline quality and long carrier lifetimes. We suggest that other precursor-mediated routes could also benefit from a slowed transformation. This could be deliberately engineered: for instance, in solvent engineering methods, the conversion of a PbI2-MAI-DMSO complex could be slowed under a high vapor pressure of DMSO, perhaps producing crystallites of higher quality.\n",
      "In conclusion we have revealed the tremendous effect of fractional, and possibly unintentional, variations in the precursor solution on a variety of properties of perovskite films, their photovoltaic performance and stability. Our results suggest that such small variations could account for the often-reported discrepancies in the literature and widely varying device performances even when fabricated in the same laboratory, and highlight the critical importance of using the same exact stoichiometry for device fabrication as for film characterization. We suggest that some published results should be carefully examined and rechecked using various perovskite recipes and stoichiometries.\n",

      "In summary, for the first time, to devise ultrafast PSC fabrication, we have exploited Ar/O2 plasma energy for the formulation of SnO2 ETLs instead of conventional thermal energy, and developed a fully oxidized compact layer within 5 min.

As a result, the photovoltaic performance was enhanced from 17.46% to 18.64% (corresponding to a champion PCE of 19.58%) when introducing the unique plasma-derived SnO2 ETLs into the PSCs due to effective electron extraction and mitigated nonradiative recombination at the P-SnO2 ETL/perovskite interface. In addition, the extent of charge carrier accumulation at the SnO2/perovskite interface was reduced in the plasma approach, which relaxed the hysteresis and improved the resistance to sunlight of PSCs. 1704825 (6 of 9) To summarize, PA provides a cost-effective, efficient PSC fabrication method for high-quality TFs with application to various metal oxides that can be made using the solgel method.\n",

The T-SnO2 ETLs were formed under the relatively harsh thermal-stress of 180 C for 1 h as previous report,[         \n",
      "In conclusion, features in RHEED associated with octahedral distortions can be used to optimize perovskite films during growth, and to prepare well-defined surfaces before the assembly of atomically-designed perovskite heterostructures. Interfaces prepared this way show reduced intermixing and lattice dilations, and improvements in our ability to impose cation doping profiles. We correlate the bulk-like transport properties of strained LSMO films with improved crystalline quality characterized by large orthorhombic domains over a wide range of doping. These results encourage the application of more stringent criteria when evaluating the properties of perovskite heterostructures. New and sophisticated defect analysis techniques will be necessary to further understand the influence of small perturbations of disorder and defects on the structural and electronic properties of distorted perovskite films, especially near interfaces.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have clearly demonstrated TDL on hybrid perovskites. This method, previously thought to be incompatible with hybrid perovskites, can be performed using commercial resists with only minor modifications to the standard lithography procedures. By combining widely available resists with the use of a PMMA protection layer, excellent-quality features are achieved while only causing minor degradation of the perovskite film. This method will make the patterning of perovskite films much more accessible to the wider scientific community, enabling a wealth of potential applications for perovskites. With the use of a mask aligner or stepper, this method can also be repeated multiple times to produce arrays of multicolor pixels. With perovskite LEDs and photodiodes making such rapid progress in recent years, the capability to produce multicolor arrays could enable the commercial production of large-area perovskite displays or camera sensors.\n",
      "For the green layered perovskite, an n = 3 stoichiometry precursor solution of (PEA)2(MA)2Pb3Br10 was prepared by dissolving lead bromide (PbBr2), phenethylammonium bromide (PEABr), and methylammonium bromide (MABr) in DMSO to make a 1 M solution. Specifically, 367 mg of PbBr2, 75 mg of MABr, and 135 mg of PEABr were dissolved in 1 mL of DMSO by stirring at room temperature for 30 min. While the solution was dissolving, glass substrates were cleaned by sonication in acetone and then IPA for 5 min, followed by plasma ashing in oxygen plasma for 3 min. The solution was then spin-coated in an N2 filled glovebox (O2 and water, <0.1 ppm) at 8000 rpm for 60 s. When the sample had been spinning for 1520 s, an anti-solvent made from chloroform containing 5 mg mL1 2,2,2-(1,3,5-benzinetriyl)-tris(1-phenyl-1-H-benzimidazole) (TPBi; Ossilla, unsublimed: 99.8%) was rapidly dropped onto the sample while spinning. The samples were then annealed at 90 C for 10 min to complete conversion. It is important to keep the O2 count as low as possible and to change the foil in the spin-coater after every  5 coatings because contaminants in the local atmosphere can strongly impact the film quality.\n",
      "The blue perovskite film was made using a chloride doped version of the same process. A high-chloride solution was made by dissolving 278 mg of PbCl2, 135.4 mg of PEABr, and 45.22 mg of methylammonium chloride in 1 mL of DMSO. This solution was then mixed in a 40:60 ratio with the pure bromide solution and then deposited via spin coating at 8000 rpm for 60 s. A solution of TPBi in chloroform was dripped on the sample after 1015 s spinning, and the sample was annealed at 90 C for 10 min.\n",
      "To make films of CH3NH3PbI3, lead iodide and methylammonium iodide were dissolved in a 1:1 stoichiometry to a 1.4 M concentration in a 9:1 DMF/DMSO solvent blend. The dissolved solution was then spin-coated at 4000 rpm for 30 s with an anti-solvent of diethyl ether being dropped onto the substrate after 7 s of spinning. The resulting films were then annealed for 3 min at 100 C.\n",
      "Once the films were fabricated, they were transferred out of the glovebox for photolithography. PMMA (A7 950 Microchem) was spin-coated onto the sample at 5000 rpm for 60 s and was then annealed at 90 C for 5 min. Once the sample had cooled, a solution of SU-8 (2000.5, Microchem) was spin-coated onto the sample at 8000 rpm for 60 s before being annealed at 90 C for 4 min. The film was then exposed to 365 nm UV light in a mask aligner for 2 min (Karl Suss MJB-3), with a post-exposure bake of 2 min at 90 C. The pattern was developed in EC (microposit) for 60 s to produce the pattern. Samples exposed using electron beams were exposed with a standard electron-beam lithography procedure with a RAITH eLine Plus lithography system. The electron energy was set to 30 keV, the aperture was set to 10 m, and the dose was 8.0 Ccm2. They were then developed in the same way as the UV samples.\n",
      "Samples in the series Li3 xOHxCl (x = 0.25, 0.5 and 0.75) were synthesised and analysed via XRD and solid-state NMR spectroscopy. The XRD patterns obtained at room temperature for each composition are shown in Fig. 3(a), where the same phase observed for Li2OHCl is also observed. The room temperature and VT 1H and 7Li MAS NMR spectra obtained for Li2.5OH0.5Cl are shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c), respectively. In each case, a single resonance is observed and, similar to Li2OHCl, there is a reduction in the linewidth with increasing temperature, again suggesting both a phase change and ion mobility. The variation in FWHM with increasing temperature for 1H and 7Li is shown in Fig. 3(d) and (e). The changes observed are similar to those observed for Li2OHCl, suggesting both protons and lithium ions are mobile at temperatures of 445 1C. Similar findings were observed for the remaining compositions in the series (see Fig. S3 and S4, ESI). A comparison of the FWHM with changing composition is shown in Fig. S5 (ESI). Small compositional changes appear to have little effect on the FWHM within this temperature range, as a similar reduction in linewidth is consistently observed across the series.\n",
      "In this work, ambipolar phototransistors based on solutionprocessed hybrid perovskites were fabricated and characterized. Owing to the superior optical and electronic properties of hybrid perovskites, our solution-processed phototransistors demonstrated high performances and tunability. Under light illumination, these devices exhibit reliable high performance with balanced carrier mobilities and on/off ratios of B104 for both p- and n-type transports. Remarkably, the phototransistors show excellent figures-of-merit such as excellent photoresponsivity (320 A W 1) and ultrafast response speed (less than 10 ms).\n",
      "We prepared PSC on solid (glass) substrate to evaluate the effect of C-PCBOD on the photovoltaic performance. PSCs on glass were made by uflorine-doped tin oxide (FTO)/titanium oxide (TiOx, 40 nm)/perovskites (350 nm)/2,2,7,7-tetrakis(N,N-di-p-methoxyphenylamine)-9,9-spirobiuflorene (SpiroOMeTAD, 300 nm)/MoO3 (8 nm)/Ag (100 nm) were fabricated. We characterized the performance of the devices with and without C-PCBOD. Figure 3a shows the current-densityvoltage (JV) characteristics under AM 1.5G illumination with the light intensity of 100 mW cm2. The performance parameters opencircuit voltage (VOC), short-circuit current density (JSC), and lfil factor (FF) are reported inset of the same gfiure. The reference device based on pristine MAPbI3 gave the best PCE of 17.8%, with JSC of 22.04 mA cm2, VOC of 1.09 V, and FF of 0.74. The MAPbI3:C-PCBOD device delivered an increased PCE up to 20.4%, with JSC of 22.60 mA cm2, VOC of 1.14 V, and FF of 0.79. The incorporation of C-PCBOD improved the VOC and FF signicfiantly, while the J SC remain rather similar as also supported by the incident photon-to-current efcfiiency (IPCE) in Figure 3b. The reproducibility of this result was evaluated testing over 30 cells, as displayed in Figure 3c. Figure 3c plots the corresponding IPCE spectra for the reference and the control devices. Figure 3d displays the steady-state photocurrent and efcfiiency measured at the maximum power point of 0.96 V from over 5 min. The PCE of the MAPbI3:C-PCBOD device stabilized at 20.0%, which was close to the value obtained from the JV measurement. 1901519 (3 of 8)\n",

      "Device Fabrication: FTO-coated glass substrates (15  sq1) were thoroughly cleaned with acetone, ethanol, and deionized water for a sequence in an ultrasonic bath for 15 min, respectively. And then the substrates were immersed into a 200 mL TiCl4 solution at 70 C for 1 h. Subsequently, the perovskite solution was then spin-coated onto the TiOx layer by a consecutive two-step spin-coating process at 1000 and 4000 rpm for 20 and 40 s, respectively. During the second spin-coating step, the substrate was treated with a chlorobenzene dropcasting. Subsequently, the as-cast film was treated by UV irradiation in the glovebox for crosslinking. Then the perovskite substrate was heated at 100 C for 10 min in nitrogen glovebox. After annealing, the Spiro-OMeTAD solution was coated onto the perovskite layer at 5000 rpm/40 s.

      "Conclusions. We report a unique synthetic approach producing CsPbX3 QDs with precisely controlled size and high ensemble uniformity by utilizing the thermodynamic equilibrium instead of the kinetic control. The size of the QDs was controlled by varying only the Br-to-Pb ratio in the reactant and the reaction temperature while being completely insensitive to the nucleation and growth kinetics. QDs virtually free from the heterogeneous broadening in their room-temperature PL spectra were obtained in a broad spectral range thanks to the superb ensemble uniformity of the size. The ability to produce precisely size-controlled CsPbX3 QDs with near-perfect spectroscopic homogeneity will enable the understanding and practical application of the quantum-confined exciton in this new family of QDs. Furthermore, because the hybrid lead halide perovskites also possess labile halide ions,2932 we anticipate that the thermodynamic equilibrium of halide can also be utilized to obtain the QDs of hybrid perovskites with precise size control.\n",
      "Experimental Section. Material Synthesis. The Cs-oleate precursor solution was prepared in a 50 mL three-necked round-bottomed flask by dissolving Cs2CO3 (0.25 g) in a mixture of oleic acid (OA, 0.8 g) and 1-octadecene (ODE, 7 g) at 150 C for >10 min under a N2 atmosphere on a Schlenk line. The temperature of the Cs-oleate solution was maintained above 100 C to avoid precipitation.

      "In summary, we have explored a new 2D hybrid perovskite ferroelectric for polarization-sensitive detection in the short wave region (>2.5 eV), affording an important complement to traditional 2D materials with narrow bandgap (<2.0 eV). Besides a high electrostatic field stemmed from ferroelectricity, its structural and optical anisotropy account for highly polarization-sensitive behaviors with a dichroism ratio of 2.0, corresponding to the maximum and minimum photoresponses along crystallographic c- and a- axes, respectively. Moreover, the exfoliated crystal-device of 1 exhibits a high photodetectivity (109 Jones) and fast photoresponse rate (20 s) to the polarized-light, along with an excellent antifatigue merit under ambient conditions. All the characteristics make 1 a promising candidate for the shortwave polarized-light detection and explore a new branch of 2D members in the class of organicinorganic hybrid perovskites for the future optoelectronic device applications.\n",
      "In conclusion, we have demonstrated a new pathway to control hysteresis and enhance performance of FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 perovskite-based planar solar cells through substitutional doping of the perovskite lattice with Gu+ cations. Our research has confirmed that Gu + is able to replace FA+ in the lattice of the perovskite compound, which in turn affects its electronic properties. Compared to the pristine FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 device, the PSCs containing 2% Gu+-dopant showed reduced interfacial charge recombination and accumulation leading to improved device performance and nearly hysteresis free. Further increase the content of GuI led to inverted hysteresis in the JV measurement, which nevertheless depends on the scan rate. This work suggests it is completely feasible to control ion migration-induced hysteresis of perovskite solar cells through doping the perovskite material with cations that have low dipole moment and large size, thus suppressing the JV hysteresis while enhancing efficiency.\n",
      "Materials Preparation: The reference mixed-cation lead triiodide perovskite (FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3) precursor solution was prepared by mixing 1 mmol FAI (Greatcell Solar), 0.2 mmol cesium idode (CsI, SigmaAldrich) and 1.32 mmol lead iodide (PbI2, Sigma-Aldrich) in 1 mL mixture of N,N-dimethylformamide (DMF)/dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) (4:1, v/v). GuI precursor solution was prepared by dissolving 1 mmol GuI in 1 mL DMSO. GuI-additive precursor solutions were prepared by mixing the reference FA0.83Cs0.17PbI3 and GuI/DMSO precursor solution precursor solution. The volume ratio of the former and the latter was ifxed at 100:0, 98:2, 95:5, 90:10, and 80:20. For convenience, the perovskite film made from the precursor containing different amount of GuI is denoted as Ref, 2%-GuI, 5%-GuI, 10%-GuI, and 20%-GuI, respectively. The GuPbI3 (1m ), CsPbI3 (1 m ), and FAPbI3 (1 m ) were prepared by dissolving 1 mmol PbI2 and 1 mmole GuI, 1 mmol PbI2 and 1 mmole CsI, 1 mmol PbI2 and 1 mmole FAI in a mixed-solvent of DMF:DMSO (4:1, v/v), respectively.

      "Device Fabrication: Prepatterned FTO-coated glass (Nippon Electric Glass, 15  1) substrate was cleaned in sequence with an aqueous solution of Decon-90 detergent (5%), followed by a mixture of acetone, isopropanol, and ethanol (1:1:1, volume ratio) for 20 min in an ultrasonic bath. UVozone treatment was then used for 30 min to improve wettability of the substrate. An n-type electron transport layer based on SnO2 (40 nm) was deposited via spin coating SnCl2 (dissolved in ethanol, 19 mg mL1) precursor solution at 3000 rpm for 30 s in air, followed by annealing in air 185 C for 1 h. Prior to be transferred to an N2-filled glove box for perovskite deposition, the SnO 2 1806479 (8 of 10) substrate was treated with UVozone for 15 min. The film was then annealed in air at 185 C for 1 h before being cleaned with UVozone for 20 min and transferred to an N2-filled glove box. The as-prepared perovskite precursor solution was spin coated on the substrate in twostep programs at 1000 rpm for 10 s and 6000 rpm for 30 s, respectively. About 17 s prior to the end of the second step, 0.15 mL of chlorobenzene was dropped onto the center of the spinning substrate before being annealed at 100 C for 1 h.

      "In this work, we investigated the influence of thermal annealing on the morphology of MAPbBr3 films, leading to the improved performance and long-term stability of PeLEDs. In particular, the thermal annealing conditions substantially influenced the morphology and quality of the MAPbBr3 films. The perovskite film annealed at 60 C for 2 h, which were found to be the optimum thermal annealing conditions, exhibited a highly crystalline and continuous morphology without vertical cracks, which was confirmed by SEM, EDS, and XRD measurements. The PeLED fabricated using a perovskite film treated under the optimum thermal annealing conditions also exhibited improved device performance, with a maximum luminance of 7850 cd m2 (at 5.1 V), a maximum luminous efficiency of 0.92 cd A1 (at 5.1 V), and a maximum EQE of 0.2%, as well as good coverage of a green EL at the turn-on voltage (at 2.5 V) and the operation voltage (at 3.7 V). Moreover, the encapsulated PeLEDs with a continuous MAPbBr3 film treated under the optimum thermal annealing conditions showed excellent longterm stability, maintaining their initial luminance values even after 162 cycles (650 h, noncontinuous test) of operation under ambient conditions because of the continuous and highly crystalline morphology of the crack-free perovskite layer. To the best of our knowledge, this study presents the best long-term stability observed in an inverted-structured PeLED. The thermal annealing of the perovskite films in PeLEDs clearly shows a correlation between the morphology of the perovskite layer and the stability of the PeLED, and we believe that it furthers the scientific study of the long-term stability and commercialization of PeLEDs. We also observed the phenomenon of emission blinking from the PeLED in the optical microscope, which indicates that the emission spots changes reversibly with time, and it seems to be related to the migration of ions under a continuous bias.\n"
